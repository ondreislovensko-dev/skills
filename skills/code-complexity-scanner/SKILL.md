  Measures cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, and function length
  across codebases to identify maintenance hotspots. Use when someone asks
  about code complexity, function length analysis, maintainability metrics,
  or needs to find the most complex parts of their codebase. Trigger words:
  complexity, cyclomatic, cognitive complexity, long functions, hotspots,
  maintainability index, code metrics.

# Code Complexity Scanner

## Overview

This skill analyzes source code to measure cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, and function length. It identifies the most complex functions and files in a codebase, helping teams focus refactoring efforts on the code that's hardest to maintain and most likely to harbor bugs.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Target Language and Files

Detect the primary language from file extensions and package files. Filter to source code only (exclude node_modules, vendor, dist, build, __pycache__, .git).

### Step 2: Measure Cyclomatic Complexity

For each function/method, count:
- `if`, `elif`/`else if` → +1 each
- `for`, `while`, `do-while` → +1 each
- `case` in switch (each case) → +1 each
- `catch` → +1
- `&&`, `||` in conditions → +1 each
- Ternary `?:` → +1
- Base complexity starts at 1

### Step 3: Measure Cognitive Complexity

More nuanced than cyclomatic — penalizes nesting:
- Each control flow break: +1
- Each nesting level: +1 additional per level
- Recursion: +1
- Boolean operator sequences that switch: +1

### Step 4: Identify Hotspot Files

Rank files by:
1. Maximum function complexity in the file
2. Average complexity across all functions
3. Number of functions above threshold (default: 15)
4. Total lines of code

### Step 5: Output Report

Present findings in three tiers:
- 🔴 **Critical** (complexity > 25): Must refactor — these functions are untestable
- 🟡 **Warning** (complexity 15-25): Should refactor when next modifying
- 🟢 **OK** (complexity < 15): Acceptable maintainability

## Examples

### Example 1: TypeScript Project Scan

**User prompt:**
```
Scan src/ for the most complex functions
```

**Agent output:**
```
Complexity Report — src/ (89 files scanned)

🔴 CRITICAL (complexity > 25)
  src/billing/calculator.ts
    calculateInvoiceTotal()     Cyclomatic: 34  Cognitive: 48  Lines: 180
    applyDiscountRules()        Cyclomatic: 26  Cognitive: 31  Lines: 95

  src/api/middleware/auth.ts
    validateAndRefreshToken()   Cyclomatic: 28  Cognitive: 35  Lines: 120

🟡 WARNING (complexity 15-25)
  src/workers/sync.ts
    reconcileRecords()          Cyclomatic: 19  Cognitive: 24  Lines: 88
  src/utils/validators.ts
    validateAddress()           Cyclomatic: 16  Cognitive: 18  Lines: 65

Summary:
  Files scanned: 89 | Functions analyzed: 412
  Average complexity: 6.8 | Median: 4
  Functions above threshold: 14 (3.4%)
  Recommended target: reduce critical functions below 15
```

### Example 2: Python Project with Trend

**User prompt:**
```
What are the complexity hotspots in our Django app?
```

**Agent output:**
```
Complexity Hotspots — myapp/ (67 files)

Top 10 by Cyclomatic Complexity:
  Rank  Function                              CC   Lines  File
  1     process_order()                       38   340    views/checkout.py
  2     generate_report()                     27   210    reports/builder.py
  3     sync_inventory()                      24   180    tasks/inventory.py
  4     parse_import_file()                   22   150    importers/csv.py
  5     calculate_shipping()                  19   95     shipping/rates.py

Nesting depth violations (>4 levels):
  views/checkout.py:142    — 6 levels deep in process_order()
  reports/builder.py:89    — 5 levels deep in generate_report()

Recommended refactoring order: process_order() first (highest complexity,
most changed file per git history, 340 lines is 3x recommended max).
```

## Guidelines

- **Thresholds are configurable** — default 15 works for most teams, but ask the user if they have a team standard
- **Cognitive > cyclomatic for human readability** — cognitive complexity better captures how hard code is to understand
- **Context matters** — a parser with complexity 20 might be acceptable; a controller with complexity 20 needs splitting
- **Combine with change frequency** — complex code that never changes is less urgent than complex code edited weekly
- **Don't count generated code** — exclude auto-generated files, migrations, and schema definitions
- **Suggest specific refactorings** — "Extract method" for long functions, "Replace conditional with polymorphism" for deep switch statements, "Introduce parameter object" for functions with 5+ parameters
