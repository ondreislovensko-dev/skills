# TikTok Marketing

## Overview

This skill helps AI agents create high-performing TikTok content and integrate with TikTok's APIs. It covers short-form video strategy, hook techniques, trending sounds, Content Posting API, analytics, and growth strategies for TikTok's For You Page algorithm.

## Instructions

### Platform Rules & Algorithm

TikTok's For You Page (FYP) algorithm:

- **Completion rate** — THE most important metric. Videos watched to the end (or replayed) get massive distribution
- **Watch time** — total seconds watched matters for longer videos
- **Shares** — strongest engagement signal (sent via DM or external)
- **Comments** — especially lengthy or emoji-heavy comments
- **Follows from video** — signals high-quality creator
- **Content-based distribution** — TikTok shows content to ANYONE interested, regardless of follower count
- **Batch testing** — new videos shown to ~200-500 people first, performance determines next batch

What kills reach:
- TikTok watermark on reposted content
- Violation of community guidelines (even borderline)
- Deleting and reposting (algorithm tracks this)
- Very long videos without retention hooks (drop-off = death)
- Static images without motion or text animation
- Mentioning other platform names ("link in my Instagram bio")

### Video Content Guidelines

#### Video Specs
- **Aspect ratio:** 9:16 (1080x1920px) — always vertical
- **Duration:** 15-60 seconds optimal. Under 30s has highest completion rates
- **Format:** MP4 or MOV, H.264 codec
- **Max file size:** 287.6 MB (mobile), 500 MB (web)
- **Max duration:** 10 minutes (but short = better for growth)
- **Frame rate:** 30fps minimum, 60fps for smooth motion

#### Hook Framework (First 1-3 seconds)
The first second determines everything. The viewer decides to scroll or stay.

**Visual hooks:**
- Start with movement or action mid-frame (not a static title card)
- Face close-up with expression (curiosity, shock, excitement)
- Before/after preview in first second
- Text overlay appearing with motion

**Verbal hooks:**
- "Stop scrolling if you [audience identifier]"
- "I can't believe this actually works"
- "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]"
- "The secret to [desired outcome] is..."
- "POV: you just discovered [interesting thing]"
- "Watch till the end — the last one is insane"

**Retention hooks (throughout video):**
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "Wait for it..."
- Text: "Part 3 will blow your mind" (encourages follow for series)
- Pattern interrupts every 3-5 seconds (zoom, cut, new angle)

#### Content Types That Work

**Educational / How-To (highest save rate)**
- 3-5 step tutorials shown visually
- "Things I wish I knew about [topic]"
- Quick tips with text overlays
- Software walkthroughs with screen recording

**Trending Audio + Niche**
- Take trending sound and apply to your industry
- Check "Trending" in TikTok's Creative Center
- Original audio can also trend — speak clearly, memorable phrases

**Storytelling**
- Personal stories with emotional arc
- "Storytime: how I [unexpected outcome]"
- Green screen with photos/screenshots as proof

**Day in the Life / Behind the Scenes**
- Authentic > polished
- Show real process, struggles, wins
- Time-lapse of work with voiceover

**Series Content**
- Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 format
- Drives follows ("follow for part 2")
- Pin part 1 to profile

### Caption & Hashtag Strategy

```
[Caption: 1-2 sentences max. Punchy, adds context or CTA]

[Hashtags: 3-5 targeted, mix of niche and broad]
```

**Caption rules:**
- Short — TikTok captions are secondary to video
- Add context the video doesn't provide
- CTA: "Save this for later 📌" or "Send to a friend who needs this"
- Max 2,200 characters but keep it under 150

**Hashtag rules:**
- 3-5 hashtags (not 30 — this isn't Instagram 2019)
- 1-2 niche hashtags (your specific topic)
- 1-2 medium hashtags (broader category)
- 1 broad hashtag (#fyp is useless now — use topical broad tags)
- TikTok SEO: use keywords naturally in caption (algorithm reads text)

### TikTok Content Posting API

#### Authentication
```typescript
// TikTok uses OAuth 2.0
const TIKTOK_AUTH_URL = 'https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/';

// Step 1: Redirect to authorization
const authUrl = new URL(TIKTOK_AUTH_URL);
authUrl.searchParams.set('client_key', process.env.TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY);
authUrl.searchParams.set('response_type', 'code');
authUrl.searchParams.set('scope', 'user.info.basic,video.publish,video.upload,video.list');
authUrl.searchParams.set('redirect_uri', process.env.TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI);
authUrl.searchParams.set('state', 'random-state');

// Step 2: Exchange code for token
const tokenRes = await fetch('https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    client_key: process.env.TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY,
    client_secret: process.env.TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET,
    code: authorizationCode,
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    redirect_uri: process.env.TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI,
  }),
});
const { access_token, refresh_token, expires_in } = await tokenRes.json();
```

#### Publish Video
```typescript
// Step 1: Initialize upload
const initRes = await fetch('https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/video/init/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    post_info: {
      title: 'Video title',
      privacy_level: 'PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE', // or MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS, SELF_ONLY
      disable_duet: false,
      disable_comment: false,
      disable_stitch: false,
      video_cover_timestamp_ms: 1000, // Cover frame at 1 second
    },
    source_info: {
      source: 'FILE_UPLOAD',
      video_size: videoFileSize, // in bytes
      chunk_size: videoFileSize, // single chunk for files < 64MB
      total_chunk_count: 1,
    },
  }),
});
const { data: { publish_id, upload_url } } = await initRes.json();

// Step 2: Upload video
await fetch(upload_url, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Range': `bytes 0-${videoFileSize - 1}/${videoFileSize}`,
    'Content-Type': 'video/mp4',
  },
  body: videoBuffer,
});

// Step 3: Check publish status
const statusRes = await fetch('https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/status/fetch/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ publish_id }),
});
// Status: PROCESSING_UPLOAD, PROCESSING_DOWNLOAD, PUBLISH_COMPLETE, FAILED
```

#### Query Videos & Analytics
```typescript
// List user's videos
const videosRes = await fetch('https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/video/list/?fields=id,title,create_time,share_url,duration,cover_image_url,like_count,comment_count,share_count,view_count', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ max_count: 20 }),
});

// Get user info
const userRes = await fetch('https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/user/info/?fields=display_name,avatar_url,follower_count,following_count,likes_count,video_count', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}` },
});
```

### Growth Strategy

**Posting schedule:** 1-3 videos/day (consistency > quality for growth phase)

**Content mix:**
- 40% trending audio + your niche (reach new audiences)
- 30% educational/tutorial (saves, shares, follows)
- 20% storytelling/behind-the-scenes (builds connection)
- 10% series/part content (drives follows for "next part")

**Best posting times:** 7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 7-10 PM (target timezone). Test and check your Analytics for YOUR audience's active times.

**Growth tactics:**
- Post 1-3x daily during growth phase (algorithm rewards consistency)
- Reply to comments with video replies (creates new content + engagement)
- Stitch/Duet trending creators in your niche (rides their distribution)
- Pin your 3 best-performing videos to profile
- Create a series with consistent format (viewers follow for next part)
- Cross-post to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts (remove TikTok watermark first using SnapTik or manual re-export)

**TikTok SEO (2025-2026):**
- TikTok is now a search engine — people search it like Google
- Use keywords in: captions, text overlays, voiceover/speech
- Answer common search queries in your niche
- Check TikTok search bar suggestions for content ideas

## Best Practices

- First 1 second = make or break. Start with hook, not intro/logo
- Under 30 seconds has highest completion rate — tight editing, no filler
- Film vertical ALWAYS — horizontal video = instant scroll
- Use trending sounds even if video is primarily text/voiceover (algorithmic boost)
- Post consistently at same times — your audience learns your schedule
- Engage with comments in first hour — drives video into next distribution batch
- Video replies to comments count as new videos — free content ideas
- Never delete underperforming videos — they can resurface weeks later
- TikTok watermark on other platforms = suppressed. Always re-export clean
- Film in good lighting and clear audio — production value matters more than ever
