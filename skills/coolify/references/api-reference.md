## Common Patterns

### Deploy and wait for completion

```bash
# Trigger deploy and capture deployment UUID
DEPLOY_UUID=$(curl -s -X POST "$COOLIFY_URL/api/v1/deploy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COOLIFY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"uuid": "app-uuid"}' | jq -r '.deployments[0].deployment_uuid')

# Poll until complete
while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -s "$COOLIFY_URL/api/v1/deployments/$DEPLOY_UUID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $COOLIFY_TOKEN" | jq -r '.status')
  echo "Status: $STATUS"
  [[ "$STATUS" == "finished" || "$STATUS" == "failed" ]] && break
  sleep 5
done
```

### Bulk sync env vars from .env file

```bash
# Convert .env file to JSON array and push
jq -R -s 'split("\n") | map(select(length > 0 and (startswith("#") | not))) |
  map(split("=") | {key: .[0], value: (.[1:] | join("="))})' .env.production | \
curl -X PATCH "$COOLIFY_URL/api/v1/applications/<uuid>/envs/bulk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COOLIFY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @-
```
