# Proposal Writer

## Overview

Create professional, persuasive business proposals structured to win deals. This skill generates complete proposal documents with executive summaries, scope of work, timelines, pricing, team qualifications, and terms. Outputs polished documents in DOCX or PDF format ready for client delivery.

## Instructions

When a user asks to write or create a business proposal, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Gather proposal requirements

Collect key information from the user:
- **Client/Recipient**: Company name, contact person, industry
- **Project/Opportunity**: What is being proposed
- **Problem statement**: What challenge the client faces
- **Proposed solution**: What you are offering
- **Scope of work**: Deliverables and activities
- **Timeline**: Key milestones and delivery dates
- **Pricing**: Budget, pricing model (fixed, hourly, retainer)
- **Team**: Key people and their qualifications
- **Differentiators**: Why you over competitors

If the user provides partial information, fill in sensible structure and mark items with [TO BE COMPLETED] placeholders.

### Step 2: Structure the proposal

Build the proposal with these standard sections:

1. **Cover Page**: Title, client name, your company, date, confidentiality notice
2. **Executive Summary**: 1-page overview of the opportunity and your solution (write this last but place it first)
3. **Understanding of Needs**: Demonstrate you understand the client's problem and goals
4. **Proposed Solution**: Detailed description of your approach and methodology
5. **Scope of Work**: Specific deliverables, activities, and what is included/excluded
6. **Timeline and Milestones**: Phased plan with dates and checkpoints
7. **Team and Qualifications**: Key personnel, relevant experience, case studies
8. **Investment / Pricing**: Cost breakdown, payment schedule, pricing model
9. **Terms and Conditions**: Payment terms, validity period, assumptions
10. **Next Steps**: Clear call to action

### Step 3: Write compelling content

For each section, follow these writing principles:

**Executive Summary:**
- Lead with the client's problem, not your company
- State the proposed solution in one clear sentence
- Highlight the key benefit and expected outcome
- Keep to one page maximum

**Understanding of Needs:**
- Mirror the client's own language and priorities
- Show research and understanding of their industry
- Connect their challenges to your expertise

**Proposed Solution:**
- Be specific about what you will do, not vague promises
- Explain your methodology step by step
- Tie each element back to a client benefit

**Pricing:**
- Present pricing clearly in a table format
- Break down by phase or deliverable
- Include what is and is not included
- Offer options when appropriate (basic/standard/premium)

### Step 4: Generate the document

```python
from docx import Document
from docx.shared import Pt, Inches, RGBColor
from docx.enum.text import WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH

def generate_proposal(data, output_path="proposal.docx"):
    doc = Document()

    # Cover page
    doc.add_paragraph("\n" * 6)
    title = doc.add_heading(data['title'], level=0)
    title.alignment = WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH.CENTER
    subtitle = doc.add_paragraph(f"Prepared for: {data['client_name']}")
    subtitle.alignment = WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH.CENTER
    date_line = doc.add_paragraph(f"Date: {data['date']}")
    date_line.alignment = WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH.CENTER
    doc.add_paragraph(f"Prepared by: {data['company_name']}")
    doc.add_page_break()

    # Add each section
    for section in data['sections']:
        doc.add_heading(section['title'], level=1)
        for paragraph in section['paragraphs']:
            doc.add_paragraph(paragraph)

        # Add tables if present (for pricing, timeline)
        if 'table' in section:
            table = doc.add_table(rows=1, cols=len(section['table']['headers']))
            table.style = 'Table Grid'
            for i, header in enumerate(section['table']['headers']):
                table.rows[0].cells[i].text = header
            for row_data in section['table']['rows']:
                row = table.add_row()
                for i, cell_val in enumerate(row_data):
                    row.cells[i].text = str(cell_val)

    doc.save(output_path)
    return output_path
```

### Step 5: Review and finalize

After generating:
1. Display a table of contents with page estimates
2. Highlight any [TO BE COMPLETED] placeholders
3. Suggest improvements or missing elements

## Guidelines

- Always write from the client's perspective. Lead with their problems and goals, not your company history.
- Use concrete numbers and specifics wherever possible. Avoid vague language like "we will improve your business."
- Include a pricing table, not just a total number. Clients want to see the breakdown.
- Offer pricing options (2-3 tiers) when the budget is flexible. This increases win rates.
- Mark all incomplete information with [TO BE COMPLETED] placeholders clearly.
- Keep proposals concise. 8-15 pages is ideal for most engagements. Avoid filler content.
- Generate DOCX by default for easy editing. Offer PDF for final delivery versions.
- Include a clear "Next Steps" section with a specific call to action and contact information.
- Add a validity period to pricing (e.g., "This proposal is valid for 30 days").
