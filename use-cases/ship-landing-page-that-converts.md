# Ship a Landing Page That Actually Converts

## The Problem

You're spending $4,200/month on Google Ads driving traffic to a landing page that converts at 0.9%. That's $33 per lead — your target CAC needs to be under $15. The page looks good, but "looks good" and "converts" are different things.

Analytics shows people leave after 8 seconds, but you don't know why. Is it the headline? The form? The load time? You've A/B tested button colors (meaningless) and changed the headline once (made it worse). CRO agencies charge $5,000-15,000/month with 3-month minimums — not viable for a bootstrapped startup.

The math is simple: moving from 0.9% to 2.5% cuts cost-per-lead from $33 to $12. Same spend, 2.7x more leads. That's the difference between burning runway and hitting growth targets.

## The Solution

The **page-cro** skill audits your page against CRO frameworks — structure, messaging, trust signals, friction, mobile, and speed. The **frontend-design** skill generates production-ready code for redesigned components. Together, they turn subjective redesign into data-informed, testable improvement.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install page-cro frontend-design
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Run a CRO audit

```
Audit our landing page at app.ourproduct.com/signup for conversion issues.
```

```
CRO Audit Results:

PAGE SPEED: 🔴 FCP 3.8s, LCP 6.2s (2.4MB hero, 847KB JS bundle)
  ~7% conversion loss per second after 3s

ABOVE THE FOLD: 🟠
  Headline: "The All-in-One Platform for Modern Teams" — generic, no value prop
  CTA below fold on mobile (68% of traffic can't see it)
  Stock photo hero — doesn't show the product

FORM: 🔴 5 fields including required phone — 23-31% abandonment from phone alone

TRUST: 🟠 No logos above fold, testimonials buried 3 scrolls down

PRIORITY FIXES (by conversion impact):
  1. Reduce form to 2 fields .............. +1.2% estimated
  2. Rewrite headline with specific value .. +0.6%
  3. Move CTA above fold .................. +0.4%
  4. Fix page speed ....................... +0.3%
  5. Add social proof above fold .......... +0.3%
  Projected: 0.9% → 2.5-3.7%
```

### 2. Redesign the hero section

```
Redesign with a specific headline, 2-field form, trust badges, and product screenshot.
```

```
  Headline: "Cut Your Reporting Time from 4 Hours to 15 Minutes"
  Subheadline: "Automated dashboards from Salesforce, HubSpot, and 50+ tools."

  Form: [Work email] [Start Free Trial →]
  "Free 14-day trial · No credit card · Setup in 2 minutes"

  Social proof: [Stripe] [Shopify] [Notion] [Linear] "Trusted by 2,400+ teams"

Generated: Hero.tsx (67 lines) + Hero.module.css (89 lines)
  Mobile: CTA visible without scroll, 48px touch targets
  Images: srcset with WebP/AVIF, lazy loading below fold
```

### 3. Fix page speed

```
Get LCP under 2.5 seconds without losing visual quality.
```

```
  Hero image: 2.4MB → 148KB (WebP + responsive srcset)
  JS bundle: 847KB → 124KB critical + 323KB deferred
  CSS: critical inlined (4.2KB), rest async
  
  FCP: 3.8s → 1.1s | LCP: 6.2s → 1.8s
  Page weight: 3.6MB → 486KB | PageSpeed: 34 → 91
```

### 4. Set up A/B testing

```
A/B test current page vs redesign with proper statistics.
```

```
  Variant A: Current page | Variant B: Redesigned hero + 2-field form
  Split: 50/50 | Sample needed: 3,847/variant (95% confidence, 80% power)
  Duration: ~14 days at 450 visits/day

  Guardrails: No peeking until minimum sample, sequential boundary at p<0.001
  Tracking: page_view, form_start, form_submit, form_abandon (by variant)
  Segments: desktop/mobile, organic/paid, new/returning
```

### 5. Analyze results

```
The test ran 16 days. Show me the results.
```

```
  Control:   3,641 visitors → 34 conversions (0.93%)
  Treatment: 3,671 visitors → 112 conversions (3.05%)

  Lift: +228% relative | Confidence: 99.7%
  Mobile: 1.02% → 3.58% (biggest gain — speed + above-fold CTA)
  
  Cost per lead: $33.00 → $9.68
  Leads/month: 127 → 437 (+244%)
  
  Deploy Variant B immediately ✓

## Real-World Example

The solo founder of a bootstrapped project management SaaS was acquiring leads at $38 each on $3,800/month ad spend — nearly double his $20 target. His freelancer-designed landing page said "Project Management Reimagined" (meaningless), had 6 form fields including a required phone number, and took 5.1 seconds to load on mobile where 61% of traffic arrived.

He ran the CRO audit Monday morning. Findings were immediately actionable. The redesigned hero was generated that afternoon. He launched the A/B test Tuesday and let it run 18 days. Result: 2.8% conversion vs 0.7%. Cost-per-lead dropped from $38 to $9.50 — same budget, 4x more leads.

The improved economics gave him confidence to increase ad spend to $6,000/month, which his investor had pushed for but hadn't made sense at the old conversion rate. Three months and two more optimization rounds later: 3.4% conversion, $28K additional monthly pipeline directly traceable to CRO improvements.
