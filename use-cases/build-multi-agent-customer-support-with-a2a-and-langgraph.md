# Build Multi-Agent Customer Support System with A2A and LangGraph

## The Problem

Dani is lead engineer at a 40-person SaaS company processing 2,000 support tickets daily. The current system is a single monolithic chatbot that handles everything — billing questions, technical issues, account management, refund requests. It works, but poorly. Billing questions get routed to a prompt stuffed with API documentation. Technical issues get answered with billing context. The team keeps adding more instructions to a single system prompt that's now 15,000 tokens long, and accuracy is dropping every week.

Dani decides to break the monolith into specialized agents that communicate via Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. Each agent is an expert in one domain. A LangGraph supervisor orchestrates the conversation, routing to the right specialist and managing handoffs when a conversation spans multiple domains.

## The Solution

Use the skills listed above to implement an automated workflow. Install the required skills:

```bash
npx terminal-skills install a2a-protocol langchain langgraph
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Define the Agent Architecture

The system has four specialist agents and one supervisor:

- **Triage Agent** — Classifies incoming messages, extracts intent and urgency
- **Billing Agent** — Handles subscription, payment, invoice, and refund queries
- **Technical Agent** — Resolves API errors, integration issues, and bug reports
- **Escalation Agent** — Manages cases that need human attention or cross-domain resolution

Each specialist exposes an A2A-compatible endpoint. The supervisor (built with LangGraph) decides which agent to call, passes context, and synthesizes responses.

```python
# agents/agent_card.py — A2A Agent Card generator
# Each agent advertises its capabilities via an Agent Card (JSON-LD)
# so the supervisor knows what each agent can do.

from dataclasses import dataclass, field, asdict
import json


@dataclass
class AgentSkill:
    """A specific capability an agent offers."""

    name: str

    tags: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    examples: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)

            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Step 2: Build the A2A-Compatible Specialist Agents

Each specialist runs as an independent service with its own A2A endpoint. The billing agent illustrates the pattern — it receives JSON-RPC messages, processes them with LangChain, and returns structured responses.

```python
# agents/billing_agent.py — Billing specialist with A2A endpoint
# Runs as an independent service on port 8001.
# Uses LangChain for LLM calls and tool execution.

])

agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, [get_subscription, change_plan, process_refund], prompt)
executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=[get_subscription, change_plan, process_refund])


# --- A2A endpoint ---

@app.get("/.well-known/agent.json")
async def agent_card():

    body = await request.json()

    rpc_id = body.get("id")

    if method == "tasks/send":
        task = params

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)
```

The technical agent follows the same pattern but with different tools (log lookup, API status check, SDK documentation search) and a different system prompt focused on debugging and technical guidance.

### Step 3: Build the LangGraph Supervisor

The supervisor is the brain of the system. It receives every incoming customer message, determines intent, routes to the right specialist via A2A, handles multi-turn conversations, and manages cross-domain handoffs.

```python
# supervisor/graph.py — LangGraph supervisor that orchestrates specialist agents
# This is the entry point for all customer conversations.
# It uses LangGraph's StateGraph to model the conversation flow.

## Real-World Example

After two weeks in production, the multi-agent system resolves 78% of support tickets without human intervention, up from 45% with the monolithic chatbot. The key improvement came from specialization — the billing agent's accuracy on refund processing jumped to 96% because its prompt and tools are focused entirely on billing, without the noise of technical documentation.

The A2A protocol made the architecture genuinely modular. When the team added a new "onboarding agent" to handle trial-to-paid conversion questions, they deployed a new service, registered its Agent Card, and added one entry to the supervisor's routing table. No changes to the billing or technical agents. No redeployment of the supervisor itself — just a config update.

The LangGraph supervisor catches cross-domain issues that the monolithic bot missed entirely. When a customer says "my payment failed and now I can't access the API," the triage node routes to billing first, which resolves the payment. The satisfaction check detects the unresolved API access issue and hands off to the technical agent — all within the same conversation turn. The customer sees one seamless interaction.

Handoff detection reduced repeat contacts by 35%. Previously, customers whose billing issue caused a technical problem would get a billing answer and then open a second ticket for the technical issue. Now the supervisor catches both in one conversation.

Average response time increased from 1.2 seconds (single LLM call) to 3.8 seconds (triage + specialist + satisfaction check), but customer satisfaction scores improved by 40% because the answers are actually correct. The team considers the tradeoff worthwhile.
