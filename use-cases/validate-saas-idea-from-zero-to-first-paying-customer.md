# Validate a SaaS Idea from Zero to First Paying Customer

## The Problem

Most developers who build side projects skip validation entirely. They spend months coding, launch to silence, and wonder what went wrong. The core issue: there's no structured process to test whether real people will pay for your idea before you write code. Discovery interviews, pricing tests, analytics frameworks, and launch playbooks exist — but stitching them into a coherent 8-week workflow requires expertise across product management, user research, and go-to-market strategy.

## The Solution

Combine five skills into a validation pipeline that takes an idea from hypothesis to first paying customer:

```bash
npx terminal-skills install lean-canvas product-discovery user-research product-analytics go-to-market
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Map the Business Model with Lean Canvas (Week 1)

Start by filling out a Lean Canvas in 20 minutes. The goal isn't perfection — it's making assumptions visible so you can test them.

**Problem** (top 3):
1. Agency owners discover projects are unprofitable only after they're delivered
2. Time tracking data and financial data live in separate tools with no connection
3. Estimating project profitability for new proposals relies on gut feeling, not data

**Customer Segments**:
Primary: Development agency owners (5-15 people, $500K-$3M revenue)
Early adopter: Agencies that already use Harvest + QuickBooks but reconcile manually

**Unique Value Proposition**:
"Know which projects make money and which don't — before it's too late."

**Solution**:
1. Auto-pull time data from Harvest, costs from QuickBooks
2. Real-time margin dashboard per project, per client, per team member
3. "Profitability forecast" for new proposals based on historical data

**Revenue Streams**: $49/month (small), $99/month (pro), $249/month (agency)

**Channels**: Content marketing (SEO), agency community forums, accountant referrals

**Key Metrics**: Signups → Connected integrations → Weekly dashboard views → Paid conversion

**Unfair Advantage**: Ravi ran an agency for 3 years and experienced this problem firsthand

Identify the riskiest assumptions — the ones that, if wrong, kill the entire idea:

1. **Desirability**: Do agency owners actually care about project profitability enough to pay for a tool?
2. **Viability**: Will they pay $99/month? (Maybe this is a $19/month problem)
3. **Feasibility**: Can you reliably pull and reconcile data from Harvest + QuickBooks APIs?

Assumption #1 is the riskiest. If nobody cares enough to pay, nothing else matters.

### Step 2: Run Discovery Interviews (Weeks 2-3)

Reach out to your network and post in relevant communities asking for 20-minute interviews. Follow the discovery interview framework — ask about past behavior, not hypothetical futures.

**Key questions:**
- "Walk me through how you figured out if your last completed project was profitable."
- "How do you decide what to charge for a new project?"
- "What happens when a project goes over budget?"
- "Have you tried any tools or approaches to solve this? What happened?"

**Synthesize patterns from interviews.** Three patterns typically emerge:

**Pattern 1 — The Surprise Loss** (6/8 mentioned this):
Most agency owners discover profitability problems months after project completion, when their accountant does quarterly reviews. One owner said: "We delivered a project in November and found out in February that we lost $12,000 on it."

**Pattern 2 — Spreadsheet Fatigue** (5/8):
Five owners maintain spreadsheets that reconcile time tracking with invoicing. They spend 2-4 hours per week on this. Three described their spreadsheet as "probably wrong but close enough."

**Pattern 3 — Pricing by Gut** (7/8):
Seven out of eight rely on experience and intuition when pricing new projects. Three admitted they've underpriced projects because they didn't realize how long similar past projects actually took.

**Surprising finding**: Three owners said per-team-member profitability data would be valuable for performance reviews and hiring decisions — an unanticipated use case.

Update the Lean Canvas with these insights. The problem is validated. But you still don't know if they'll pay $99/month.

### Step 3: Test Willingness to Pay (Week 4)

Before writing code, design a smoke test. Create a landing page describing the product with three pricing tiers and a "Join Waitlist" button. Drive 200 visitors via targeted LinkedIn ads ($150 budget, targeting "agency owner" and "dev studio founder").

Measure:
- Waitlist signups (email submitted)
- Which pricing tier page they viewed longest
- Survey response from waitlist: "What would you expect to pay for this?"

**Results after 1 week:**
- 200 visitors, 34 waitlist signups (17% conversion — strong signal)
- Most time spent on the $99/month tier page
- Survey responses (22 answered): median expected price was $79/month
- 4 people emailed asking "when can I try this?"

The pricing assumption is partially validated. Adjust to $79/month for launch with a $49/month starter tier.

### Step 4: Define Metrics and Build the MVP (Weeks 5-6)

With validated demand, define the product analytics framework before writing code.

**North Star Metric**: Weekly active agencies viewing their profitability dashboard

**Input metrics:**
1. Activation: % of signups who connect at least one integration (Harvest or QuickBooks)
2. Engagement: Dashboard views per agency per week
3. Depth: Projects tracked per agency
4. Conversion: Free trial → paid within 14 days

**AARRR funnel with targets:**
- Acquisition: 50 signups/month from waitlist + content
- Activation: 60% connect an integration within 24 hours
- Retention: 50% return to dashboard weekly after week 1
- Revenue: 15% convert to paid after 14-day trial
- Referral: 10% invite a colleague or recommend to another agency

Instrument every step from day one — no launching without analytics.

The MVP is deliberately small: connect Harvest + QuickBooks, show a per-project margin view (revenue minus time cost), and display a monthly trend. No forecasting, no team-member breakdown, no proposal pricing tool. Those come after the core value is validated.

### Step 5: Soft Launch and Go-to-Market (Weeks 7-8)

Launch to waitlist signups first — they're the warmest audience.

**Pre-launch** (3 days before):
- Email waitlist: "You're getting early access this Thursday"
- Set up Intercom for in-app feedback
- Prepare a 90-second demo video showing real (anonymized) data

**Launch day** (Thursday — avoids Monday chaos and Friday apathy):
- Morning: Send access emails to all 34 waitlist members
- Afternoon: Post in 3 agency communities where you interviewed users
- Evening: Respond to every piece of feedback personally

**First week results:**
- 34 waitlist invites → 28 activated → 19 connected at least one integration
- 12 agencies viewed their dashboard 3+ times in the first week
- 6 agencies connected both Harvest AND QuickBooks
- 3 people hit a bug with QuickBooks OAuth — fixed within 24 hours

**Week 2:**
- 4 agencies reached the end of their trial
- 3 converted to paid ($79/month each = $237 MRR on day 14)
- 1 said "love it but need Toggl integration, not just Harvest"

## Real-World Example

Ravi, a senior developer freelancing for five years, noticed every client agency (5-15 people) struggled to track project profitability. His idea: a dashboard connecting Harvest, QuickBooks, and GitHub to show real-time project margins.

The entire validation took 8 weeks and cost $150 (LinkedIn ads for the smoke test). Compare this to his previous approach: 4 months of building followed by a launch to nobody.

The discovery interviews changed the product direction twice. The original idea focused on "real-time dashboards," but interviews revealed the bigger pain was retrospective — finding out about losses months later. The MVP focused on connecting historical data, not real-time streaming. This was simpler to build and solved the actual problem.

The pricing test saved him from undercharging. His initial instinct was $29/month. The survey showed agency owners expected to pay $79-99/month. Charging $79/month instead of $29 means he needs 3x fewer customers to reach any revenue milestone.

The waitlist converted at 17% — well above the 3-5% benchmark for cold traffic. This told him the positioning was right before he wrote a single line of code.

Three paying customers in 8 weeks isn't a business yet. But it's proof that real people will pay real money for this solution — the most important validation a new product can achieve.
