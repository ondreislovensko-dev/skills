# Automate Cross-Browser Testing with AI

## The Problem

Your web app looks perfect in Chrome, but customers on Safari report broken layouts, and Firefox users see a flash of unstyled content on page load. Your QA process is a developer manually opening the app in three browsers before each release, clicking through key flows, and hoping they catch visual regressions. This takes 3-4 hours per release, misses subtle CSS differences, and is the first thing skipped when deadlines are tight. Last month, a Safari flexbox bug shipped to production and stayed there for two weeks because nobody tested on WebKit.

## The Solution

Use the **test-generator** skill to create comprehensive cross-browser test suites from your existing pages, the **coding-agent** to configure Playwright for multi-browser execution, and the **web-scraper** to capture baseline screenshots for visual comparison.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install test-generator coding-agent web-scraper
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Ask the agent to analyze your app for cross-browser risk areas

```
Our app is a Next.js dashboard at http://localhost:3000. Key user flows:
login, dashboard overview, create report, export to PDF. We have zero
cross-browser tests. Set up automated testing across Chrome, Firefox,
and Safari. Focus on the areas most likely to break.
```

### 2. The agent identifies high-risk components

```
Cross-Browser Risk Analysis:

High risk (CSS features with known browser differences):
- Dashboard grid: uses CSS subgrid (no Firefox support before v117)
- Date picker: uses :has() selector (Safari 15.3 doesn't support it)
- Export modal: backdrop-filter for blur effect (partial Firefox support)
- PDF preview: uses CSS container queries

Medium risk (JavaScript behavior differences):
- File upload: drag-and-drop API differences in Safari
- Rich text editor: clipboard paste handling varies across browsers
- Infinite scroll: IntersectionObserver threshold differences

Low risk: Standard layouts, form submissions, navigation
```

### 3. The agent generates Playwright test suites

```
Generated test files:

tests/
├── cross-browser/
│   ├── login.spec.ts          # Auth flow across all browsers
│   ├── dashboard-layout.spec.ts  # Grid rendering, responsive breakpoints
│   ├── create-report.spec.ts     # Form interactions, date picker
│   ├── export-pdf.spec.ts        # Modal, file download
│   └── visual-regression.spec.ts # Screenshot comparisons
├── playwright.config.ts        # Multi-browser configuration
└── fixtures/
    └── test-data.ts

Browser matrix:
- Chromium (Chrome 121)
- Firefox (120)
- WebKit (Safari 17.2)
- Mobile Safari (iPhone 14 viewport)
- Mobile Chrome (Pixel 7 viewport)
```

### 4. The agent captures visual baselines

```
Capturing baseline screenshots across 5 browser configurations...

Screenshots saved to tests/screenshots/baseline/:
- login-page: 5 screenshots (all browsers match)
- dashboard-overview: 5 screenshots
  ⚠ Firefox diff detected: subgrid fallback renders 2px gap difference
- create-report-modal: 5 screenshots (all match)
- export-dialog: 5 screenshots
  ⚠ Safari diff detected: backdrop-filter not rendering blur

Generated fallback CSS for 2 detected issues:
- dashboard.module.css: added @supports fallback for subgrid
- modal.module.css: added -webkit-backdrop-filter prefix
```

### 5. The agent integrates tests into CI

```
Updated .github/workflows/test.yml:

Cross-browser tests run on every PR:
- Parallel execution: 3 browsers × 5 test files = 15 jobs
- Visual regression: compares against baseline screenshots
- Flake detection: retries failed tests once before reporting
- Artifacts: uploads diff screenshots on failure

Total CI time impact: +4 minutes (runs in parallel with existing tests)
```

## Real-World Example

Aisha is a frontend lead at a 20-person SaaS startup. Their product is a data dashboard used by enterprise clients, some of whom mandate Safari on corporate MacBooks. Every other release breaks something in Safari or Firefox, and the team only finds out from support tickets.

1. Aisha asks the agent to set up cross-browser testing for their four critical user flows
2. The agent analyzes the codebase, identifies 7 high-risk CSS features, and generates Playwright tests covering all flows across 5 browser configurations
3. During baseline capture, the agent immediately finds two rendering issues — a subgrid gap in Firefox and a missing blur effect in Safari — and generates CSS fixes
4. Tests run on every PR in CI, adding just 4 minutes to the pipeline
5. Over the next quarter, the cross-browser tests catch 6 regressions before they reach production, and Safari-related support tickets drop to zero
