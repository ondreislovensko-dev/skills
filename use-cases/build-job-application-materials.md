# Build Targeted Job Application Materials

## The Problem

A senior software engineer with 8 years of experience is applying to 5-6 positions per week across different company types: startups, enterprise, and FAANG. Each role emphasizes different aspects of their background. Sending the same generic resume to every posting gets a 3% response rate.

Tailoring each application manually takes 2-3 hours per job, and they cannot sustain that volume alongside a full-time role. Their current CV lists every technology they have touched but buries the relevant achievements under a wall of bullet points. Their cover letters are generic enough that a recruiter could swap in any company name without noticing the difference.

## The Solution

Use the **cv-builder** skill to generate role-specific CVs that highlight the most relevant experience and quantified achievements, and the **cover-letter** skill to write concise letters that connect the candidate's background to the specific role requirements.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Analyze the target job posting

Extract key requirements and priorities from the job description to guide both documents:

> Analyze this Senior Backend Engineer posting at Watershed (climate tech, Series B, 120 employees). Extract the top 5 required skills, 3 preferred qualifications, and the key themes in the role description. Identify which of my experiences are most relevant: I have 4 years building distributed systems at a fintech startup, 2 years on infrastructure at a mid-size SaaS company, and 2 years as a full-stack engineer at an agency. I led a team of 4, reduced API latency by 60%, and migrated a monolith to microservices.

The analysis should rank requirements by emphasis in the posting. Skills mentioned in the first two paragraphs and repeated throughout carry more weight than those listed near the bottom.

### 2. Generate a tailored CV

Build a CV that leads with the most relevant experience for this specific posting:

> Generate a one-page CV for the Watershed Senior Backend Engineer role. Lead with my distributed systems experience at Pinnacle Fintech since that matches their microservices architecture requirement. Quantify achievements: reduced P99 API latency from 1200ms to 480ms, designed event-driven architecture handling 2.3M daily transactions, led migration from monolith to 12 microservices over 6 months. Include my AWS and Kubernetes experience prominently since the posting mentions cloud infrastructure. Place my agency experience last and keep it to two lines. Use a clean, ATS-friendly format with no columns, tables, or graphics.

Every bullet point should follow the "accomplished X by doing Y, resulting in Z" pattern. Hiring managers scan resumes in 6-8 seconds, so the first bullet under each role must be the strongest.

### 3. Write a targeted cover letter

Draft a cover letter that connects specific achievements to the role requirements:

> Write a cover letter for the Watershed Senior Backend Engineer position. Open with genuine interest in climate tech, referencing their carbon accounting platform. Connect my monolith-to-microservices migration directly to their stated need for someone who can scale their data pipeline. Mention the latency optimization work as evidence of performance engineering skills. Keep it under 300 words. Address it to the hiring manager (Diane Kowalski, VP Engineering, per LinkedIn). Close with a specific reference to their recent Series B and the engineering challenges that come with scaling from 120 to 300 employees.

A cover letter should never restate the resume. Its job is to answer "why this company" and "why you should read my resume more carefully." Company-specific references show the candidate did research beyond reading the job posting.

### 4. Optimize for applicant tracking systems

Review both documents for keyword coverage and ATS compatibility:

> Review my CV and cover letter against the Watershed job posting for ATS optimization. Check that these keywords from the posting appear naturally in my materials: distributed systems, microservices, event-driven architecture, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, CI/CD, data pipelines. Flag any important posting keywords I am missing. Verify the CV format uses standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills) that ATS parsers expect. Ensure no critical information is in headers or footers where parsers might miss it.

ATS optimization means placing keywords in context, not stuffing them into a skills section. A bullet point that says "migrated data pipelines from batch to event-driven architecture on Kubernetes" covers three keywords naturally while also demonstrating experience.

### 5. Prepare variant for a different role type

Adapt the base materials for a contrasting role at an enterprise company:

> Using the same work history, generate a CV variant for the Staff Platform Engineer role at Datadog. Reorder to emphasize infrastructure and observability experience. Elevate the Kubernetes cluster management work and the monitoring dashboards I built at SaaSGrid. De-emphasize the full-stack agency work entirely. Write a new cover letter that focuses on platform engineering at scale rather than climate impact.

The same experience tells different stories depending on what you emphasize. Infrastructure roles want to see scale numbers (requests per second, cluster size, uptime). Product roles want to see user impact (conversion improvements, feature adoption).

## Real-World Example

The engineer starts their weekly application batch on Sunday evening. For the Watershed role, the CV leads with the distributed systems work and the cover letter references their carbon accounting platform by name. For the Datadog role, the same experience is reframed around infrastructure and observability. For a startup CTO role at a seed-stage company, a third variant leads with the team leadership experience and monolith migration.

Each application takes 20 minutes instead of 2.5 hours. Over the next two weeks, the response rate jumps from 3% to 18%. Watershed's recruiter specifically mentions that the cover letter's reference to their Series B scaling challenges stood out from 200 other applications. The Datadog recruiter notes that the CV clearly demonstrated experience at the scale they operate. The targeted approach produces 4 interviews from 12 applications, compared to 1 interview from 30 applications with the generic resume.
