# Audit Web Accessibility Compliance with AI

## The Problem

The European Accessibility Act takes effect in June 2025, ADA lawsuits against web properties hit a record 4,600+ in 2024, and your product has never had a formal accessibility audit. You know there are issues — the login form uses placeholder text instead of labels, the navigation dropdown traps keyboard focus, and color contrast is inconsistent — but manually auditing 80+ pages against 50 WCAG 2.2 success criteria would take weeks. Automated tools like axe catch only about 30% of violations, and the remaining 70% require human judgment about whether ARIA patterns are correct, focus management works properly, and screen reader announcements make sense.

## The Solution

Feed your components and page templates to the AI agent for a deep accessibility audit. It goes beyond automated scanners — analyzing keyboard interaction patterns, ARIA semantics, focus management in modals and dynamic content, and color contrast computations — to produce a prioritized violation report with exact code fixes for each issue.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install accessibility-auditor code-reviewer frontend-design
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit the most critical user flows first

```
Audit the accessibility of our signup flow: src/pages/signup.tsx, src/components/SignupForm.tsx, and src/components/PasswordStrength.tsx. Check against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. This needs to be compliant before June.
```

The agent analyzes all three files and produces:

```
Accessibility Audit: Signup Flow
==================================
14 violations found (5 Critical, 6 Major, 3 Minor)

CRITICAL [WCAG 1.3.5] Autocomplete missing on all 4 form fields
  Inputs: name, email, password, confirm-password
  Users with motor disabilities rely on autofill. Required by WCAG 1.3.5.
  Fix:
    <input name="name" autoComplete="name" />
    <input name="email" autoComplete="email" />
    <input name="password" autoComplete="new-password" />
    <input name="confirm" autoComplete="new-password" />

CRITICAL [WCAG 3.3.2] Password field has no visible label
  Current: placeholder="Create a password" with no <label>
  Placeholder disappears on focus — users forget what field they're typing in.
  Fix: <label htmlFor="password">Create a password</label>
       <input id="password" type="password" ... />

CRITICAL [WCAG 4.1.2] Password strength meter not accessible
  PasswordStrength.tsx renders 4 colored bars with no text alternative.
  Screen reader users get zero feedback about password strength.
  Fix: Add aria-live="polite" region:
    <div aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">
      Password strength: {strengthLabel} ({score}/4)
    </div>
    Plus visible text label: "Weak" / "Fair" / "Strong" / "Very strong"

CRITICAL [WCAG 1.4.1] Strength meter uses color only
  Red/yellow/green bars convey strength. Color-blind users cannot distinguish.
  Fix: Add text labels and icons (✗ Weak, → Fair, ✓ Strong, ✓✓ Very strong)

CRITICAL [WCAG 3.3.1] Validation errors not announced
  When form submission fails, error messages appear visually but
  screen readers are not notified.
  Fix: Wrap error container in role="alert":
    <div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">{errors.map(...)}</div>
    Associate each error: aria-describedby="email-error" on the input

MAJOR [WCAG 2.4.7] Focus not moved to first error on submit
  After failed submission, focus stays on submit button. Keyboard users
  must Tab backwards to find which field has an error.
  Fix: On validation failure, focus the first invalid input:
    firstInvalidRef.current.focus();

[...6 Major and 3 Minor violations with fixes omitted for brevity]
```

### 2. Fix critical issues and verify

```
I've implemented the 5 critical fixes. Review my changes in the git diff and check if the ARIA patterns are correct.
```

The agent reviews the diff:

```
Code Review: Accessibility Fixes
==================================
4/5 fixes correctly implemented. 1 issue:

⚠ PasswordStrength.tsx:28 — aria-live region is inside a conditionally
  rendered block. When strength changes from null to "Weak", the region
  mounts for the first time — screen readers don't announce initial
  content of newly mounted aria-live regions.

  Fix: Render the aria-live container unconditionally (always in DOM),
  update only the text content:
    <div aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">
      {strength ? `Password strength: ${strength}` : ''}
    </div>

All other ARIA patterns are correct. autocomplete values match the spec.
Error association via aria-describedby is properly wired.
```

### 3. Audit remaining pages systematically

```
Now audit these 6 component files that appear on every page: Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, Navigation.tsx, SearchBar.tsx, MobileMenu.tsx, CookieBanner.tsx. These are shared components so fixing them fixes accessibility site-wide.
```

The agent audits all shared components and finds 23 issues, including a keyboard trap in the mobile menu, missing skip-to-content link, and cookie banner that steals focus on every page load.

### 4. Generate a compliance report

```
Generate a WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance summary showing: total violations found, violations fixed, remaining issues, and our compliance percentage by WCAG principle (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust).
```

```
WCAG 2.2 Level AA Compliance Report
======================================
Date: February 2026

Summary:
  Total violations found:    37
  Violations fixed:          19
  Remaining to fix:          18
  Compliance rate:           73% → projected 100% after remaining fixes

By Principle:
  Perceivable (1.x):    12 found, 8 fixed, 4 remaining   — 67% compliant
  Operable (2.x):       11 found, 5 fixed, 6 remaining   — 55% compliant
  Understandable (3.x):  9 found, 4 fixed, 5 remaining   — 56% compliant
  Robust (4.x):          5 found, 2 fixed, 3 remaining   — 60% compliant

High-Risk Remaining Items:
  1. Mobile menu keyboard trap (affects all mobile keyboard users)
  2. Data table missing row/column headers (affects screen reader users)
  3. Auto-playing carousel with no pause control (WCAG 2.2.2)
```

## Real-World Example

A frontend engineer at a 30-person HR tech company receives notice that their largest enterprise client requires WCAG 2.2 AA compliance for contract renewal in 90 days. The application has 12 page templates and 45 shared components, none built with accessibility in mind.

1. The engineer starts with the 8 most-used shared components, feeding them to the agent for audit
2. The agent finds 37 violations total, with 11 Critical (blocking for screen reader and keyboard users)
3. Critical fixes for shared components take 3 days — affecting every page in the application at once
4. The agent then audits page-specific templates, finding 14 additional issues
5. After 2 weeks, all violations are resolved. The agent generates a compliance report for the client
6. Manual testing with VoiceOver and NVDA confirms no remaining issues

What was estimated as a 3-month project is completed in 2 weeks, and the contract is renewed.
