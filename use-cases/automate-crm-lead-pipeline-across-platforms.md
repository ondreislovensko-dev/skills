# Automate CRM Lead Pipeline Across Salesforce and Zoho

## The Problem

A B2B software company receives 300 inbound leads per week from webinars, content downloads, and demo requests. The marketing team captures leads in Zoho CRM, but the enterprise sales team works exclusively in Salesforce. Leads sit in Zoho for days before someone manually copies qualified ones into Salesforce.

By then, competitors have already responded. The sales director estimates they lose 15-20% of high-intent leads to slow handoff. There is no scoring system to distinguish a VP downloading a whitepaper from an intern browsing the blog, so every lead gets the same treatment.

## The Solution

Use the **lead-qualification** skill to score and segment inbound leads automatically, then use **zoho** and **salesforce** skills to sync qualified leads between platforms with enriched data and trigger assignment rules based on territory and deal size.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define lead scoring criteria

Configure a scoring model that evaluates leads based on firmographic and behavioral signals:

> Score all leads in Zoho CRM using these criteria: company size over 50 employees gets 20 points, director-level or above title gets 15 points, demo request source gets 25 points, technology industry gets 10 points. Leads scoring 60 or above are MQL-qualified. Pull company data from the Zoho lead record and enrich with LinkedIn company size where available.

The scoring criteria should reflect your actual ICP. Weight behavioral signals (demo requests, pricing page visits) higher than firmographic ones because intent matters more than company size. Adjust thresholds monthly based on which scored leads actually convert to opportunities.

### 2. Qualify and segment leads in Zoho

Run the scoring model against the current Zoho lead queue and tag each lead with its score and segment:

> Query all Zoho CRM leads created in the last 7 days with status "New". Apply the scoring model to each lead. Update the lead record with the computed score in the custom field "Lead_Score" and set "Lead_Segment" to "Enterprise" if score is 60 or above, "Mid-Market" if 40-59, or "SMB" if below 40.

Segmenting leads by score threshold creates different follow-up cadences. Enterprise leads get same-day outreach, Mid-Market gets a nurture sequence, and SMB leads enter a self-serve onboarding flow.

### 3. Sync qualified leads to Salesforce

Push MQL-qualified leads from Zoho into Salesforce as new Lead records with full context:

> For each Zoho lead with Lead_Score >= 60, create a Salesforce Lead record. Map Zoho fields to Salesforce: Company to Company, Email to Email, Phone to Phone, Lead_Score to Lead_Score__c, Lead_Segment to Lead_Segment__c. Set Lead Source to "Inbound - Zoho" and Status to "MQL Qualified". Assign to the correct Salesforce user based on territory: West Coast leads to Sarah Chen, East Coast to Marcus Williams, International to Priya Kapoor.

The field mapping between Zoho and Salesforce should include custom fields that preserve context. Territory assignment rules prevent leads from sitting in a generic queue. Include the original Zoho lead ID as a custom field in Salesforce for traceability and deduplication.

### 4. Create follow-up tasks and Salesforce campaigns

Generate immediate follow-up actions for the sales team so no lead goes cold:

> For each newly synced Salesforce Lead, create a Task with subject "Initial outreach - [Company Name]", due date tomorrow, and priority High. Add the lead to the active Salesforce Campaign "Q1 2026 Inbound Pipeline". If the lead source was "Demo Request", set task priority to Urgent and due date to today.

Demo request leads get priority treatment because they signal the highest buying intent. Setting the task due date to today ensures same-day response, which research shows increases contact rates by 7x compared to next-day follow-up.

### 5. Generate pipeline summary report

Produce a weekly snapshot showing lead flow, conversion rates, and pipeline health:

> Generate a report showing: total leads received this week in Zoho, number qualified as MQL, number synced to Salesforce, average lead score by source channel, and leads still pending qualification. Include a breakdown by segment showing Enterprise vs Mid-Market vs SMB counts.

The weekly report surfaces trends over time. If webinar leads consistently score higher than content download leads, the marketing team can allocate more budget to webinars. If a particular industry segment is growing in the pipeline, the sales team can prepare industry-specific materials.

## Real-World Example

The marketing team runs a webinar on Tuesday that generates 87 new leads in Zoho. By Wednesday morning, the scoring model has evaluated all 87: 23 score above 60 and qualify as MQLs, 31 fall into Mid-Market, and 33 are SMB. The 23 enterprise leads sync to Salesforce within minutes, each assigned to the correct territory rep with a follow-up task due that day. Sarah Chen in the West Coast territory picks up her 8 assigned leads before lunch and books 3 discovery calls by end of day. Before automation, those leads would have sat untouched in Zoho until Friday when someone remembered to export a CSV.

The pipeline summary at the end of the first month shows that average lead-to-qualified time dropped from 4.2 days to 6 hours, and the MQL-to-opportunity conversion rate increased from 12% to 19% because reps are reaching leads while buying intent is still fresh. The weekly report also reveals that webinar leads score 22 points higher on average than whitepaper download leads, prompting the marketing team to shift $4,000 monthly budget from gated content to live events.
