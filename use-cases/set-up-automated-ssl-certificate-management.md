# Set Up Automated SSL Certificate Management with AI

## The Problem

A 15-person engineering team manages 24 SSL certificates across production services, staging environments, API endpoints, and internal tools. Certificates are renewed manually — someone gets a calendar reminder, logs into the provider, generates a new cert, and deploys it across the relevant servers. Last quarter, a wildcard certificate expired on a Saturday night, taking down the API and three customer-facing services for 2 hours before the on-call engineer figured out the cause. Two other certificates expired within 30 days of each other, creating a stressful scramble. There's no central inventory of certificates, their expiration dates, or which services depend on them.

## The Solution

Use the **coding-agent** to build certificate monitoring and renewal automation, the **cicd-pipeline** to integrate certificate deployment into your release process, and **n8n-workflow** to orchestrate renewal notifications and automated actions.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install coding-agent cicd-pipeline n8n-workflow
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Inventory all certificates

Tell the agent to discover and catalog your certificates:

```
Scan all our domains and subdomains, check the SSL certificates on each, and create an inventory. Include: domain, issuer, expiration date, days until expiry, certificate type (single, wildcard, SAN), and which services use it.
```

### 2. The agent builds a certificate inventory

```
SSL Certificate Inventory — 24 certificates found:

Critical (expires within 30 days):
- *.api.example.com     — Expires: Mar 12, 2026 (23 days) — Used by: API gateway, webhooks
- admin.example.com     — Expires: Mar 08, 2026 (19 days) — Used by: Admin panel

Upcoming (expires within 90 days):
- app.example.com       — Expires: Apr 28, 2026 (70 days) — Used by: Main web app
- docs.example.com      — Expires: May 03, 2026 (75 days) — Used by: Documentation site

Healthy (90+ days):
- 20 certificates with 90-365 days remaining

Inventory saved: ssl-inventory.json
```

### 3. Set up automated monitoring

```
Create a monitoring system that checks certificate expiration daily, alerts at 60/30/14/7 days, and sends notifications to Slack with renewal instructions.
```

The agent creates the monitoring pipeline:

```
Certificate monitoring configured:

Daily check: Scans all 24 endpoints at 6:00 AM UTC
Alert thresholds:
- 60 days: Info message to #infrastructure channel
- 30 days: Warning with renewal instructions
- 14 days: Urgent alert, tags @oncall
- 7 days: Critical alert, tags @engineering-lead
- Expired: P0 incident alert with rollback steps

Monitoring script: scripts/check-ssl-certs.sh
n8n workflow: ssl-monitoring-workflow.json
```

### 4. Automate Let's Encrypt renewals

For certificates using Let's Encrypt, the agent sets up fully automated renewal:

```
Set up auto-renewal for all Let's Encrypt certificates. Use certbot with DNS challenge for wildcard certs and HTTP challenge for single-domain certs. Deploy renewed certs automatically and reload the affected services.
```

```
Auto-renewal configured for 18 Let's Encrypt certificates:

Renewal pipeline:
1. Certbot checks renewal eligibility (30 days before expiry)
2. DNS/HTTP challenge completed automatically
3. New certificate deployed to target servers via SCP
4. Nginx/service reload triggered on affected hosts
5. Post-renewal verification (TLS handshake test)
6. Slack notification: "✅ Certificate renewed for app.example.com — valid until 2026-08-17"

Cron schedule: Daily at 3:00 AM UTC
Remaining manual certificates: 6 (purchased from vendor, renewal reminders only)
```

### 5. Add certificate checks to CI/CD

The agent adds certificate validation to your deployment pipeline:

```
CI integration added to deployment workflow:

Pre-deploy check:
- Verify target domain certificate is valid and not expiring within 7 days
- Fail deployment if certificate is expired or missing
- Warn if certificate expires within 30 days

Post-deploy check:
- Verify TLS handshake succeeds on deployed service
- Check certificate chain is complete (no missing intermediates)
- Validate HSTS headers are present
```

## Real-World Example

Nina is the platform engineer at a 15-person SaaS startup. After a 2-hour outage caused by an expired wildcard certificate on a Saturday night, she decides to automate certificate management.

1. She asks the agent to scan all domains and build a certificate inventory — it finds 24 certificates, 2 expiring within 3 weeks
2. The agent sets up daily monitoring with tiered Slack alerts at 60, 30, 14, and 7 days before expiry
3. It configures certbot auto-renewal for 18 Let's Encrypt certificates with automated deployment and service reload
4. For the 6 vendor-purchased certificates, it creates renewal reminders with step-by-step instructions
5. Three months later, 12 certificates have auto-renewed without any human intervention. The team hasn't had a single certificate-related incident since
