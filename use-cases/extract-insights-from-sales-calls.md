# Extract Product Insights from Hundreds of Sales Call Recordings

## The Problem

Marta, Head of Product at a 45-person SaaS company, stares at a folder of 238 sales call recordings from Q4. Each call averages 28 minutes — that's 111 hours of customer conversations sitting untapped. The sales team religiously records every demo and discovery call, but nobody has time to listen. Product decisions happen in Slack threads like "a few customers asked for SSO" or "someone mentioned competitor X."

Last quarter's roadmap was built on the loudest voice in the room. The team shipped a mobile app (requested by 2 customers) while ignoring API rate limiting (mentioned in 34 calls, caused 8 deal losses). Win rate dropped from 24% to 18%. Exit interviews revealed that 73% of lost prospects cited missing features that were never prioritized because the data was buried in audio files.

The math is brutal: 5 sales reps × 12 calls/week × 28 minutes = 280 hours of customer intelligence per month. Zero systematic analysis. Product-market fit discussions based on "I think customers want..." instead of "customers said 47 times that they need..." The company is making million-dollar product bets on hearsay while the real data sits in Google Drive, unheard.

## The Solution

Combine **voice-to-text** for bulk transcription, **data-analysis** for pattern recognition, **report-generator** for structured insights, and **content-writer** for stakeholder communication. The approach: batch transcribe all recordings, extract and categorize feature requests with frequency counts, identify deal-breaking objections, and produce executive-ready insights with quantified customer demand.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install voice-to-text data-analysis report-generator content-writer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Batch transcribe all sales recordings

```
Transcribe all .mp3 files in /sales-calls/2024-Q4/. Each file is a recorded Gong call between our sales rep and a prospect. Generate speaker-labeled transcripts with timestamps and save as markdown files in /transcripts/. Include call metadata from filename patterns (rep name, prospect company, call type, date).
```

```

### 2. Extract structured insights across all transcripts

```
Analyze all 238 transcripts in /transcripts/. Extract and categorize: specific feature requests (with quotes), objections that killed deals, competitor mentions, pricing feedback, integration needs. Count frequency across calls and identify patterns. Export as structured JSON for further analysis.
```

```

### 3. Generate comprehensive insights report

```
Generate a product insights report from the sales call analysis. Rank feature requests by business impact (frequency × average deal size), identify the biggest revenue blockers, and create data-driven recommendations for Q1 roadmap prioritization.
```

🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Q4 Sales Call Intelligence
238 calls analyzed • 67 prospects • $4.2M total pipeline reviewed

KEY FINDING:
Missing SSO integration cost us $346K in lost deals last quarter and represents our biggest revenue unlock. 28% of all prospects explicitly requested SAML SSO, with average deal sizes 52% higher than prospects who didn't mention it.

IMMEDIATE REVENUE RECOVERY OPPORTUNITIES:
• SSO Implementation (Q1): $346K immediate deal recovery + $2.8M pipeline acceleration
• API Rate Limiting (Q1): $287K immediate recovery, enables enterprise expansion  
• Pricing Optimization: Address $234K lost to "too expensive" objections (23 deals)

CUSTOMER VOICE:
"We can't move forward without SAML SSO. It's a hard requirement from our security team, and every vendor we evaluate has it." - TechCorp CTO ($67K ARR opportunity)

"Your rate limits kill our batch processing workflows. We need enterprise-grade API controls." - DataFlow Solutions Architect ($45K ARR opportunity)

COMPETITIVE IMPACT:
CompetitorX is winning deals primarily on SSO availability (12 instances). We're stronger on usability and support, but missing SSO is neutralizing our advantages with enterprise prospects.

RECOMMENDATION:
Reallocate Q1 engineering resources to prioritize SSO (6-week sprint) and API improvements (3-week sprint). Combined ROI projection: $633K immediate recovery + $4.1M pipeline acceleration = 7.2x return on engineering investment.

The data is clear: our prospects are telling us exactly what to build. We just needed to listen systematically.

## Real-World Example

A Series B marketing automation company's product team was building features based on sales team hunches rather than systematic customer feedback. Their Head of Product, frustrated with declining win rates, decided to analyze 6 months of recorded sales calls to understand why deals were being lost.

The voice-to-text skill processed 412 call recordings (184 hours of audio) in under 2 hours. Data analysis revealed that "single sign-on" appeared in 156 calls (38% of all conversations), but it wasn't on the roadmap. The skill found that SSO requests correlated with 67% higher deal values, and 34 deals worth $1.2M were explicitly lost due to missing SSO.

The generated report showed that while the team had been building a mobile app (requested by 3% of prospects), they'd ignored SSO (requested by 38%). Within two weeks of the analysis, SSO moved to the top of the sprint backlog. When the company launched SSO three months later, they re-engaged 23 of the previously lost prospects and closed $847K in deals that had been stalled on the missing feature.

The systematic analysis revealed a pattern: high-value enterprise prospects consistently mentioned security and compliance features, while smaller prospects requested workflow optimizations. This insight led to a two-track product strategy that increased win rates from 18% to 31% within six months.
