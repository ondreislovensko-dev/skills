# Deploy a Private VPN for a Remote Team

## The Problem

A 25-person distributed startup needs secure access to internal services — staging servers, databases, admin panels — that should never be exposed to the public internet. The team currently relies on IP allowlists and SSH tunnels, which break constantly as people move between home, coffee shops, and coworking spaces. Every location change means updating firewall rules and re-establishing tunnels.

Five team members also work from countries with heavy internet censorship where standard VPN protocols get detected and blocked within hours. WireGuard lasts a day, OpenVPN over TCP maybe two, and commercial VPN services get flagged instantly. The team needs a corporate VPN with split tunneling on the same server as an undetectable proxy for restricted regions.

## The Solution

Using the **openvpn** skill to set up a corporate VPN with split tunneling, per-user certificates, and TOTP-based MFA, alongside the **xray** skill to configure VLESS with Reality protocol for censorship-resistant access that looks like normal HTTPS traffic. Both services coexist on one server — OpenVPN on UDP 1194 and Xray on TCP 443.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Prepare the Server

Start with a clean Ubuntu 22.04 server (2 CPU, 4GB RAM, public IP):

```text
I have an Ubuntu 22.04 server (2 CPU, 4GB RAM, public IP). Install OpenVPN with EasyRSA, Google Authenticator for MFA, and Xray for the Reality proxy. Configure the firewall and enable IP forwarding.
```

The base installation covers all packages, Xray via the official installer, firewall rules for all three services, and IP forwarding:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install -y openvpn easy-rsa libpam-google-authenticator mailutils ufw

# Xray via official installer
bash -c "$(curl -L https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh)" @ install

# Firewall: SSH + OpenVPN + Xray
ufw allow 22/tcp && ufw allow 1194/udp && ufw allow 443/tcp && ufw enable

# IP forwarding for VPN routing
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf && sysctl -p
```

### Step 2: Build PKI and Configure OpenVPN

The PKI uses elliptic curve crypto (secp384r1) instead of RSA for smaller keys and faster handshakes:

```text
Create a CA with elliptic curve crypto, generate server certs, and configure OpenVPN with split tunneling — only internal traffic (10.0.0.0/8) goes through the VPN, internet stays direct. Enable MFA via PAM with Google Authenticator.
```

```bash
make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca && cd ~/openvpn-ca
cat > vars <<'EOF'
set_var EASYRSA_ALGO ec
set_var EASYRSA_CURVE secp384r1
set_var EASYRSA_CA_EXPIRE 3650
set_var EASYRSA_CERT_EXPIRE 365
EOF

./easyrsa init-pki && ./easyrsa build-ca nopass
./easyrsa gen-req server nopass && ./easyrsa sign-req server server
./easyrsa gen-dh && openvpn --genkey secret ta.key
cp pki/ca.crt pki/issued/server.crt pki/private/server.key pki/dh.pem ta.key /etc/openvpn/server/
```

The split tunneling configuration is the important part. Only internal network traffic routes through the VPN — everything else (web browsing, video calls, streaming) stays on the user's local connection. This means the VPN doesn't slow down daily internet use, and the server doesn't become a bandwidth bottleneck for 25 people:

```ini
port 1194
proto udp
dev tun
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0

# Split tunneling — only push internal routes, no redirect-gateway
push "route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0"
push "route 172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0"
push "route 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0"
push "dhcp-option DNS 10.0.0.2"

cipher AES-256-GCM
auth SHA384
tls-version-min 1.2

# MFA via Google Authenticator
plugin /usr/lib/openvpn/openvpn-plugin-auth-pam.so openvpn

status /var/log/openvpn/status.log 10
max-clients 50
crl-verify crl.pem
```

NAT and service startup:

```bash
IFACE=$(ip route get 1.1.1.1 | awk '{print $5; exit}')
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o "$IFACE" -j MASQUERADE
apt install -y iptables-persistent && netfilter-persistent save

mkdir -p /var/log/openvpn
systemctl enable --now openvpn-server@server
```

### Step 3: Automate User Provisioning and Revocation

Manual certificate generation for 25 people is a recipe for mistakes. One script handles the full onboarding: generate a client certificate, set up TOTP, build a self-contained `.ovpn` file, and email it to the new team member:

```text
Write a provisioning script: given a username and email, generate a client certificate, set up TOTP, create a self-contained .ovpn file, and email it. Write a revocation script for instant access termination.
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# provision-user.sh — cert + TOTP + .ovpn + email in one command
set -e
USER=$1; EMAIL=$2; SERVER_IP="YOUR_SERVER_IP"; CA_DIR=~/openvpn-ca
[ -z "$USER" ] || [ -z "$EMAIL" ] && echo "Usage: ./provision-user.sh user email" && exit 1

cd "$CA_DIR"
./easyrsa gen-req "$USER" nopass
./easyrsa sign-req client "$USER"

# Generate TOTP secret for Google Authenticator
mkdir -p /etc/openvpn/totp
google-authenticator -t -d -f -r 3 -R 30 -w 3 -s "/etc/openvpn/totp/$USER" --no-confirm
TOTP_SECRET=$(head -1 /etc/openvpn/totp/$USER)

# Build self-contained .ovpn (no extra files needed)
mkdir -p ~/client-configs
cat > ~/client-configs/"$USER".ovpn <<OVPN
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote $SERVER_IP 1194
cipher AES-256-GCM
auth SHA384
auth-user-pass
key-direction 1
<ca>
$(cat "$CA_DIR/pki/ca.crt")
</ca>
<cert>
$(sed -n '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/p' "$CA_DIR/pki/issued/$USER.crt")
</cert>
<key>
$(cat "$CA_DIR/pki/private/$USER.key")
</key>
<tls-auth>
$(cat "$CA_DIR/ta.key")
</tls-auth>
OVPN

mail -s "VPN Access" -A ~/client-configs/"$USER".ovpn "$EMAIL" <<MAIL
Your .ovpn file is attached. Install OpenVPN Connect, import it, and set up
Google Authenticator with secret: $TOTP_SECRET
When connecting: username=$USER, password=your TOTP code.
MAIL
echo "Provisioned $USER ($EMAIL)"
```

Revocation is equally fast — one command kills access instantly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# revoke-user.sh — immediately revoke access
USER=$1; cd ~/openvpn-ca
./easyrsa revoke "$USER" && ./easyrsa gen-crl
cp pki/crl.pem /etc/openvpn/server/crl.pem
rm -f /etc/openvpn/totp/"$USER" ~/client-configs/"$USER".ovpn
systemctl restart openvpn-server@server
echo "Revoked access for $USER"
```

No manual certificate management, no forgetting to revoke when someone leaves. The entire employee VPN lifecycle is two commands.

### Step 4: Configure Xray VLESS with Reality Protocol

For the five team members in restricted countries, standard VPN protocols won't survive. Reality protocol makes traffic indistinguishable from a normal HTTPS connection to microsoft.com — DPI systems see what looks like legitimate TLS 1.3 traffic and let it through:

```text
Set up Xray with VLESS + Reality for 5 users. Reality impersonates a real website (microsoft.com) to defeat DPI — no domain or TLS cert needed. Enable per-user traffic stats via the Xray stats API.
```

```bash
# Generate credentials — one UUID per user, one x25519 keypair for the server
xray uuid    # Run 5 times for 5 users
xray x25519  # Save the private and public key pair
```

The Xray configuration at `/usr/local/etc/xray/config.json`:

```json
{
  "stats": {},
  "policy": {
    "levels": { "0": { "statsUserUplink": true, "statsUserDownlink": true } }
  },
  "api": { "tag": "api", "services": ["StatsService"] },
  "inbounds": [
    {
      "listen": "127.0.0.1", "port": 10085,
      "protocol": "dokodemo-door",
      "settings": { "address": "127.0.0.1" }, "tag": "api"
    },
    {
      "listen": "0.0.0.0", "port": 443, "protocol": "vless", "tag": "proxy",
      "settings": {
        "clients": [
          { "id": "UUID_1", "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision", "email": "alice@proxy" },
          { "id": "UUID_2", "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision", "email": "bob@proxy" },
          { "id": "UUID_3", "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision", "email": "carol@proxy" },
          { "id": "UUID_4", "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision", "email": "dave@proxy" },
          { "id": "UUID_5", "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision", "email": "eve@proxy" }
        ],
        "decryption": "none"
      },
      "streamSettings": {
        "network": "tcp", "security": "reality",
        "realitySettings": {
          "dest": "www.microsoft.com:443",
          "serverNames": ["www.microsoft.com", "microsoft.com"],
          "privateKey": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
          "shortIds": ["", "abcdef1234567890"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "outbounds": [
    { "protocol": "freedom", "tag": "direct" },
    { "protocol": "blackhole", "tag": "block" }
  ],
  "routing": {
    "rules": [
      { "type": "field", "inboundTag": ["api"], "outboundTag": "api" },
      { "type": "field", "ip": ["geoip:private"], "outboundTag": "block" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Add Subscription Server and Monitoring

Mobile clients like v2rayNG and Hiddify support subscription links that auto-configure the connection. A lightweight subscription server makes onboarding trivial — share a link and the client configures itself:

```text
Create a subscription server for v2rayNG/Hiddify compatibility, monitoring scripts for both services, and a weekly Xray auto-update cron job.
```

```javascript
// sub-server.js — subscription endpoint for mobile clients
const http = require("http");
const SERVER_IP = "YOUR_SERVER_IP";
const PBK = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY";
const SID = "abcdef1234567890";

const users = {
  "token-alice": { uuid: "UUID_1", name: "Alice-Reality" },
  "token-bob":   { uuid: "UUID_2", name: "Bob-Reality" },
  "token-carol": { uuid: "UUID_3", name: "Carol-Reality" },
  "token-dave":  { uuid: "UUID_4", name: "Dave-Reality" },
  "token-eve":   { uuid: "UUID_5", name: "Eve-Reality" },
};

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const token = req.url.replace("/sub/", "");
  const user = users[token];
  if (!user) { res.writeHead(404); return res.end("Not found"); }

  const link = `vless://${user.uuid}@${SERVER_IP}:443` +
    `?encryption=none&flow=xtls-rprx-vision` +
    `&security=reality&sni=www.microsoft.com` +
    `&fp=chrome&pbk=${PBK}&sid=${SID}&type=tcp#${user.name}`;

  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  res.end(Buffer.from(link).toString("base64"));
}).listen(8080, "127.0.0.1");
```

Monitoring scripts for both services:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# vpn-status.sh — connected OpenVPN clients and bandwidth
awk '/CLIENT LIST/,/ROUTING TABLE/' /var/log/openvpn/status.log | \
  grep -v "CLIENT LIST\|Common Name\|ROUTING TABLE\|Updated" | \
  while IFS=',' read -r name addr recv sent since; do
    [ -z "$name" ] && continue
    printf "  %s | %s | down:%.1fMB up:%.1fMB | %s\n" \
      "$name" "$addr" "$(echo "$recv/1048576" | bc -l)" "$(echo "$sent/1048576" | bc -l)" "$since"
  done
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# xray-stats.sh — per-user Xray traffic
for user in alice bob carol dave eve; do
  up=$(xray api stats -server=127.0.0.1:10085 -name "user>>>${user}@proxy>>>traffic>>>uplink" 2>/dev/null | awk '/value/{print $2}')
  down=$(xray api stats -server=127.0.0.1:10085 -name "user>>>${user}@proxy>>>traffic>>>downlink" 2>/dev/null | awk '/value/{print $2}')
  printf "  %s | up:%.1fMB down:%.1fMB\n" "$user" "$(echo "${up:-0}/1048576" | bc -l)" "$(echo "${down:-0}/1048576" | bc -l)"
done
```

Weekly auto-update keeps Xray current with the latest protocol improvements:

```bash
# Add to crontab — updates every Sunday at 3 AM
0 3 * * 0 bash -c "$(curl -L https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh)" @ install && systemctl restart xray
```

### Step 6: Test End-to-End

```bash
# OpenVPN — verify split tunneling works
openvpn --config alice.ovpn
ping 10.0.0.1        # Reaches internal network through VPN
curl ifconfig.me     # Shows client's own IP (internet stays direct)

# Xray — import subscription in v2rayNG, then verify
curl -x socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 https://ifconfig.me  # Shows server IP
```

If `ping 10.0.0.1` succeeds and `curl ifconfig.me` shows the client's own IP (not the server's), split tunneling is working correctly. Internal traffic routes through the VPN, everything else stays direct.

## Real-World Example

Leo provisions the dual-stack server on a Friday afternoon. By Monday, all 25 employees have `.ovpn` files and Google Authenticator configured via the provisioning script. Split tunneling means developers access internal staging servers through the VPN while video calls and web browsing use their local connection — no bandwidth bottleneck, no latency on Zoom calls.

When an intern's contract ends on their last day, one `revoke-user.sh` command kills access in seconds. No waiting for IT tickets, no "can someone remove their access?" messages in Slack a week later.

The five team members in restricted countries import subscription links into v2rayNG. Reality protocol makes their traffic indistinguishable from normal HTTPS visits to microsoft.com, so DPI systems let it through. Over three months, the proxy stays unblocked while other VPN solutions in the same countries get detected and blocked within days. The weekly auto-update keeps Xray current, and monitoring scripts give Leo visibility into usage across both services.
