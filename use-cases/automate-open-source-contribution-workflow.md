# Automate Open Source Contribution Workflow with AI

## The Problem

Your engineering team wants to contribute to the open source projects you depend on, but nobody has time to trawl through issue trackers, read contribution guides, figure out CLA requirements, and prepare properly formatted PRs. A senior developer might spend 3-4 hours just finding a suitable issue and understanding the repo conventions before writing a single line of code. Most contributions stall because the overhead of getting started is too high.

## The Solution

Use the **github** skill to search for issues and manage PRs, **code-reviewer** to understand repository conventions, and **coding-agent** to implement fixes. The agent handles the tedious parts — finding issues, reading CONTRIBUTING.md files, checking CLA requirements — so your team can focus on writing code.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install github
npx terminal-skills install code-reviewer
npx terminal-skills install coding-agent
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Find suitable issues in your dependency graph

Tell the agent which projects matter to your team:

```
Search for good-first-issue and help-wanted labels in these repos: facebook/react, vercel/next.js, and prisma/prisma. Filter for issues opened in the last 30 days that haven't been assigned yet.
```

### 2. The agent returns a prioritized list

The agent queries GitHub's API, filters by labels and assignment status, and ranks issues by activity and complexity:

```
Found 14 unassigned issues across 3 repos:

1. vercel/next.js #58234 - Fix middleware redirect loop with trailing slashes
   Labels: good-first-issue, bug  |  Opened: 3 days ago  |  Comments: 2
   Complexity: Low — isolated to one middleware handler

2. prisma/prisma #21847 - Add TypeScript example for nested create with relations
   Labels: help-wanted, docs  |  Opened: 5 days ago  |  Comments: 0
   Complexity: Low — documentation addition

3. facebook/react #29182 - useReducer type inference breaks with discriminated unions
   Labels: good-first-issue, type: bug  |  Opened: 12 days ago  |  Comments: 7
   Complexity: Medium — requires TypeScript type changes
```

### 3. Analyze the contribution requirements

Pick an issue and ask the agent to prepare:

```
I want to work on vercel/next.js #58234. Read their CONTRIBUTING.md, check for CLA requirements, and tell me what I need to do before submitting a PR.
```

### 4. The agent builds a contribution checklist

```
Contribution checklist for vercel/next.js:

- [x] CLA: Contributor License Agreement required — sign at https://cla.vercel.com
- [x] Branch: Fork and create branch from canary (not main)
- [x] Tests: Must include integration test in test/integration/
- [x] Linting: Run pnpm lint before submitting
- [x] Changeset: Run pnpm changeset to generate a changelog entry
- [x] PR template: Must reference the issue number and describe the fix

I've read the related code in packages/next/src/server/web/spec-extension/response.ts.
The bug is in the redirect() function — it doesn't strip trailing slashes before checking
the redirect target, causing an infinite loop.
```

### 5. Implement and submit the PR

```
Create the fix for issue #58234. Write the code change and the integration test, then prepare the PR description following their template.
```

The agent writes the fix, generates the test, formats the PR body with the required sections, and gives you the git commands to push.

## Real-World Example

Dani is a backend developer at a 15-person startup that relies heavily on Prisma for database access. The team keeps hitting a Prisma edge case with JSON fields, and Dani found an open issue for it. Using the contribution workflow:

1. Dani asks the agent to analyze prisma/prisma issue #21650 and the repo's contribution setup
2. The agent reads CONTRIBUTING.md, finds the CLA bot link, identifies the relevant package in the monorepo, and locates the existing test patterns
3. Dani signs the CLA, then asks the agent to implement the fix following the repo's testing conventions
4. The agent writes the fix in `packages/client/src/runtime/core/jsonProtocol/serialize.ts`, adds a test in `packages/client/tests/functional/json-fields/`, and drafts the PR description
5. Dani reviews the code, pushes to her fork, and opens the PR — total time from issue to PR: 45 minutes instead of half a day

## Tips for Open Source Contributions

- **Start with documentation** — docs PRs have the highest acceptance rate and help you learn the codebase
- **Read recent merged PRs** — they show the actual code style and PR conventions better than any guide
- **Comment on the issue first** — claim the issue publicly before starting work to avoid duplicate effort
- **Keep PRs small** — a focused 50-line fix gets reviewed in hours; a 500-line refactor sits for weeks
- **Run the full test suite locally** — CI failures on your first PR make a bad impression
- **Be patient with reviews** — maintainers are volunteers; a polite follow-up after a week is fine, daily pings are not

### Contribution Workflow Checklist

The agent verifies each of these before you submit:

- [ ] Fork is up to date with upstream main/canary branch
- [ ] Branch name follows the project's convention
- [ ] Commit messages match the required format (conventional commits, etc.)
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Linter and formatter have been run
- [ ] CLA or DCO is signed if required
- [ ] PR description fills in all required template sections
- [ ] Related issue is referenced with closing keyword
