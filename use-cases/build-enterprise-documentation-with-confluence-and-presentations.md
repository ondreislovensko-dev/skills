# Build Enterprise Documentation with Confluence and Presentations

## The Problem

A 200-person SaaS company maintains product documentation in Confluence and presents quarterly business reviews as PowerPoint decks. The two are completely disconnected. Engineering updates Confluence with new feature documentation, but the QBR deck references outdated feature lists.

The onboarding team maintains a separate set of slides that duplicate content from Confluence pages. When pricing changes, someone updates Confluence, someone else updates the sales deck, and a third person updates the onboarding slides. By the end of each quarter, the three sources have diverged enough to confuse new hires and embarrass salespeople. A new hire last month quoted outdated pricing from the onboarding deck during a customer call.

## The Solution

Use the **confluence** skill to structure and maintain the canonical knowledge base, and the **powerpoint** skill to generate presentation decks that pull content directly from Confluence pages, ensuring a single source of truth.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Structure the Confluence knowledge base

Organize Confluence spaces and page hierarchies for the product documentation:

> Create a Confluence space called "Product Hub" with this page hierarchy: top-level pages for Platform Overview, Feature Catalog, Pricing and Plans, API Documentation, and Release Notes. Under Feature Catalog, create child pages for each product module: Analytics Dashboard, User Management, Integrations, Reporting Engine, and Workflow Automation. Each feature page should follow a template with sections: Description, Key Capabilities (bulleted list), Use Cases, Current Limitations, and Roadmap Status. Start with the Analytics Dashboard page using these details: real-time event tracking, custom dashboard builder, 15 pre-built report templates, export to CSV and PDF, retention analysis with cohort charts.

A consistent page template across all feature pages ensures that every module is documented to the same depth. This structure also makes it possible to programmatically extract content for presentations.

### 2. Generate a quarterly business review deck from Confluence

Build a QBR presentation that sources its content from the Confluence knowledge base:

> Create a PowerPoint presentation for the Q4 2025 Quarterly Business Review. Pull content from the Confluence "Product Hub" space. Slide structure: Title slide with company name and quarter, Executive Summary (3 bullet points from the Platform Overview page), Feature Releases This Quarter (list from the Release Notes page filtered to Q4 2025), Product Metrics (placeholder slides for ARR, DAU, and feature adoption charts), Pricing Updates (current tier table from the Pricing and Plans page), Roadmap Preview (from Roadmap Status sections across feature pages), and Q&A slide. Use the company brand template: dark navy background, white text, green accent color for headers and highlights.

Sourcing presentation content from Confluence means the QBR deck is only as stale as the wiki. When engineering updates a feature page, the next deck generation includes the updated content automatically.

### 3. Create onboarding materials from existing documentation

Generate a new hire onboarding deck that draws from the same Confluence source:

> Build a 20-slide onboarding presentation for new Product team members. Source content from Confluence "Product Hub". Include: Company and Product Overview (from Platform Overview), Architecture Overview (high-level system diagram description from API Documentation), Feature Deep Dives (one slide per module from Feature Catalog, focusing on Description and Key Capabilities), Competitive Positioning (from any competitive analysis pages), and Key Processes (from team workspace pages). Keep each slide to 4-5 bullet points maximum. Add speaker notes with additional context pulled from the full Confluence page content.

Speaker notes are the bridge between the brief slide content and the detailed Confluence pages. New hires get a scannable overview on the slides and can drill into the full wiki page when they need depth.

### 4. Update Confluence and regenerate affected decks

When product information changes, update the source of truth and propagate:

> Update the Confluence "Pricing and Plans" page: the Growth tier is increasing from $79/month to $89/month effective March 1, 2026. Add a note about the price change with the effective date. After updating Confluence, identify which PowerPoint presentations reference pricing data: the QBR deck (slide 6) and the onboarding deck (slide 12). Regenerate those specific slides with the updated pricing information. Add a "Updated Feb 2026" footer to the modified slides.

Updating one Confluence page and regenerating affected slides takes 10 minutes. The previous process of finding every deck that mentions pricing, opening each one, and manually editing the numbers took over an hour and inevitably missed one.

### 5. Publish release notes across both formats

Document a new feature release in Confluence and generate a release announcement deck:

> Add a new entry to the Confluence Release Notes page for v3.8.0 (February 2026): new Workflow Automation module with visual flow builder, 12 pre-built automation templates, webhook triggers, conditional branching, and Slack/email action nodes. Update the Workflow Automation feature page under Feature Catalog with the full capability list. Then generate a 6-slide product announcement deck: title slide, problem statement, feature overview with key capabilities, screenshot placeholder slides for the flow builder UI, availability and pricing (included in Growth and Enterprise tiers), and a next steps slide with links to documentation.

Release announcements are the highest-urgency use case. The sales team needs updated materials within 24 hours of a feature launch, and generating from the already-written Confluence page eliminates the usual bottleneck of waiting for someone to "make a deck."

## Real-World Example

The product team ships a new Workflow Automation module in February. The PM updates the Confluence Feature Catalog and Release Notes pages in 20 minutes. From those pages, three deliverables are generated: a 6-slide launch announcement deck for the sales team, updated slides in the QBR deck showing Q1 feature releases, and a refreshed onboarding deck with the new module included.

When the VP of Sales asks "is the onboarding deck current?" the answer is yes, because it was regenerated from the same Confluence source that engineering updated last Tuesday. The pricing update the following week changes one Confluence page, and two slides across two decks update in minutes. No more version drift between the wiki and the slide decks, and no more embarrassing moments when a new hire's onboarding deck contradicts what the product actually does.
