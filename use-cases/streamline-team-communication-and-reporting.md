# Streamline Team Communication and Weekly Reporting

## The Problem

A team lead manages 8 engineers and reports to two directors. Every Friday, they spend 2 hours compiling a weekly status report by checking each engineer's work, reviewing completed PRs, and summarizing progress. The same information then gets reformatted into three different emails: a detailed version for the directors, a high-level summary for the VP, and a team-facing retrospective digest.

Monday morning adds another hour drafting individual emails to team members about the upcoming week's priorities. The reports are always late because Friday afternoon is packed with meetings, and the quality suffers because the lead is rushing through the writing. Last month, the VP asked why a risk was not flagged earlier, and the answer was that it appeared in the director-level report but not in the VP summary because the lead ran out of time to write both versions properly.

## The Solution

Use the **weekly-report** skill to generate structured status reports from project data and the **email-drafter** skill to format those reports into audience-appropriate emails with the right level of detail and tone.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Generate the weekly status report

Compile the week's accomplishments, metrics, and blockers into a structured report:

> Generate the weekly status report for the Platform Engineering team, week of February 17-21, 2026. Completed items: migrated authentication service to new OAuth provider (Marcus, 3 days), fixed rate limiter race condition in production (Yuki, 1 day), shipped API v3 pagination endpoints (Amir and Priya, 4 days), updated CI pipeline to reduce build times by 40% (Chen, 2 days). In progress: database sharding for the events table (Marcus and Amir, 60% complete, on track for next Wednesday), new caching layer for read-heavy endpoints (Yuki, 30% complete). Blocked: mobile SDK release waiting on App Store review since Tuesday. Metrics: 4 PRs merged, 0 production incidents, build time reduced from 12 minutes to 7 minutes. Risks: the database sharding work has a dependency on DevOps for the connection pool configuration, which has not been scheduled yet.

The report should prioritize impact over activity. "Reduced CI build times by 40%, saving 40 minutes per developer per day" is more meaningful than "updated CI pipeline configuration files."

### 2. Draft the executive summary email for leadership

Create a concise version of the report for the VP who reads 15 reports per week:

> Draft an email to VP of Engineering Lisa Park summarizing the Platform team's week. Keep it under 100 words. Lead with the biggest win (CI build time reduction saving 40 minutes per developer per day across 8 engineers). Mention the OAuth migration completion as a security milestone. Flag the one risk: database sharding depends on DevOps capacity that is not yet allocated. End with next week's focus: completing the sharding work and starting the caching layer. Tone: confident, factual, no hedging language.

Executives scan reports looking for three things: wins to celebrate, risks to address, and blockers to remove. Structuring the email around these three categories ensures it gets read and acted on.

### 3. Send detailed report to the directors

Format the full report for the two directors who need implementation details:

> Draft an email to Directors Tomasz Kowalski and Rebecca Chen with the full weekly report. Include all completed items with engineer names and time spent, the in-progress items with percentage completion and expected dates, the blocker with specific context (App Store review submitted Tuesday for mobile SDK v2.4.1, typical turnaround is 3-5 business days), and the DevOps dependency risk with a suggested resolution (requesting 4 hours of DevOps time in next week's sprint planning). Attach the metrics in a compact table format. Tone: thorough, action-oriented.

The director-level email includes suggested resolutions, not just problems. Instead of "we need DevOps help," it says "requesting 4 hours of DevOps time in next week's sprint planning." This makes it easy for the directors to act on the request.

### 4. Create the team-facing weekly digest

Write an internal team message celebrating wins and setting up next week:

> Draft a Slack message for the #platform-eng channel summarizing the week. Open with a shout-out to Chen for the build time improvement that everyone will notice Monday morning. Acknowledge Marcus and Yuki's work on the OAuth migration and rate limiter fix. Mention the database sharding progress and what the team should expect next week. Keep the tone casual and appreciative. Close with next week's priorities: finish sharding by Wednesday, start caching layer, and prepare for the quarterly architecture review on March 3. Under 200 words.

The team-facing message uses a different tone than the leadership email. Engineers respond better to specific acknowledgment of their work than to abstract metrics. Naming the person and their contribution builds team morale.

### 5. Draft Monday priority emails for individual team members

Write brief individual messages setting context for the upcoming week:

> Draft individual priority emails for 3 team members for Monday morning. For Marcus: top priority is completing the database sharding by Wednesday, secondary task is reviewing Amir's pagination PR that is still in draft. For Yuki: start the caching layer design document, share the draft with the team by Thursday for feedback. For Priya: pick up the mobile SDK release once App Store review clears, then move to the API documentation updates that have been backlogged. Each email should be 3-4 sentences, direct, and reference the relevant Jira tickets by number.

Individual priority emails eliminate the Monday morning "what should I work on?" question. They also create a written record of agreed priorities, which prevents the common problem of mid-week priority changes that go unacknowledged.

## Real-World Example

On Friday at 3 PM, the team lead generates the weekly report from their notes on what each engineer completed. By 3:30, three versions of the report have been drafted: the VP gets a 90-word email highlighting the CI improvement and the DevOps dependency risk, the directors get the full breakdown with metrics and suggested actions, and the team Slack channel gets a celebratory summary that leads with Chen's build time win. Monday morning, Marcus, Yuki, and Priya each find a short priority email waiting in their inbox with clear focus areas for the week.

The total time spent on reporting drops from 3 hours across Friday and Monday to 45 minutes, and the reports are consistently delivered on time because the drafting is no longer the bottleneck. The VP responds to the risk flag within an hour, allocating DevOps time for the database sharding dependency before it becomes a blocker the following week.
