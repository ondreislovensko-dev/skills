# Build Automated Payroll Calculation and Reporting with AI

## The Problem

Payroll is one of those tasks that seems simple until you actually do it at scale.
A 30-person agency tracks hours in spreadsheets. Every two weeks the office manager spends an entire day copying timesheet data into a payroll template, manually calculating overtime, applying tax withholdings, and generating individual pay stubs as PDFs. One misplaced decimal means an underpayment that erodes trust. The process involves five different spreadsheets, and reconciling them is where most errors creep in. The team has grown from 10 to 30 people in a year and the manual approach is breaking.

## The Solution

Use the **excel-processor** skill to ingest and normalize timesheet data from multiple spreadsheets. Feed the cleaned data into the **report-generator** skill to compute gross pay, overtime, deductions, and net pay. Finally use the **template-engine** skill to stamp out individual pay stubs and a company-wide payroll summary PDF.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install excel-processor
npx terminal-skills install report-generator
npx terminal-skills install template-engine
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Ingest and normalize timesheets

Tell your AI agent:

```
Read all .xlsx files in the /payroll/timesheets-jan-15/ folder. Each file has columns for employee name, date, hours worked, and project code. Merge them into a single table and flag any rows with missing data or hours over 16 in a day.
```

The agent uses **excel-processor** to parse each file and produce:

```
Merged timesheet: 30 employees, 420 rows
Flagged issues:
  - Row 87: Marta Oliveira, Jan 9 — 18 hours (exceeds 16h threshold)
  - Row 203: Tomas Ferreira, Jan 12 — missing project code
```

### 2. Calculate gross pay and overtime

```
Using the merged timesheet and the salary table in /payroll/salary-rates.xlsx, calculate gross pay for each employee. Apply 1.5x for hours over 40 per week. Output a summary table.
```

The **report-generator** skill computes:

```
Payroll Period: Jan 1-15, 2025

| Employee | Regular Hours | OT Hours | Regular Pay | OT Pay | Gross Pay |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Marta Oliveira | 80.0 | 6.5 | $4,800.00 | $585.00 | $5,385.00 |
| Tomas Ferreira | 76.0 | 0.0 | $3,800.00 | $0.00 | $3,800.00 |
| Lena Nowak | 80.0 | 3.0 | $5,200.00 | $390.00 | $5,590.00 |
... 27 more employees
```

### 3. Apply deductions and compute net pay

```
Apply federal tax withholding based on each employee's W-4 data in /payroll/w4-elections.xlsx. Deduct health insurance premiums from /payroll/benefits.xlsx. Calculate net pay for each employee.
```

```
Deductions Applied:

| Employee | Gross Pay | Federal Tax | State Tax | Health Ins | Net Pay |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Marta Oliveira | $5,385.00 | $861.60 | $269.25 | $245.00 | $4,009.15 |
| Tomas Ferreira | $3,800.00 | $570.00 | $190.00 | $245.00 | $2,795.00 |
```

### 4. Generate individual pay stubs

```
Using the pay stub template in /payroll/templates/pay-stub.html, generate a PDF pay stub for each employee. Save them to /payroll/output/stubs/jan-15/.
```

The **template-engine** skill fills in each employee's data and renders 30 PDF pay stubs in seconds. Each stub includes the pay period, gross pay breakdown, itemized deductions, net pay, and year-to-date totals.

### 5. Produce the payroll summary report

```
Generate a payroll summary report showing total gross, total deductions by category, total net pay, and a department-level breakdown. Save as PDF and Excel.
```

The agent combines all calculations into a single summary document:

```
Payroll Summary — Jan 1-15, 2025
Total Gross Pay: $142,650.00
Total Federal Tax: $22,824.00
Total State Tax: $7,132.50
Total Benefits: $7,350.00
Total Net Pay: $105,343.50

Department Breakdown:
  Engineering (12 people): $52,140.00 net
  Design (6 people): $24,300.00 net
  Operations (12 people): $28,903.50 net
```

## Real-World Example

Rui manages operations at a 30-person digital agency. Payroll day used to consume eight hours of copying numbers between spreadsheets, double-checking overtime math, and generating pay stubs one at a time in Word. After setting up this workflow, Rui drops the timesheet files into a folder, runs one command, and has verified pay stubs and a summary report in under three minutes. Errors dropped to zero in the first quarter because the agent flags anomalies before any calculation runs.
