# Allocate Infrastructure Costs Across Teams with AI

## The Problem

Your cloud bill is $47,000 per month and growing 15% quarter over quarter, but nobody can explain which team or service is driving the increase. Engineering says it is the data team's Spark jobs. The data team blames staging environments that never get torn down. Finance wants per-team cost breakdowns for budget planning, but your tagging strategy is inconsistent — only 60% of resources have proper cost-allocation tags. The CFO is asking hard questions, and the one person who understood the billing dashboard left the company.

## The Solution

Use **data-analysis** to parse and categorize cloud billing exports, **excel-processor** to merge billing data with team ownership mappings, and **report-generator** to produce monthly cost allocation reports with trend analysis.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install data-analysis excel-processor report-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Export your billing data and team mappings

```
Here's our AWS Cost and Usage Report for January (cost-usage-2026-01.csv.gz),
our team-service ownership spreadsheet (service-owners.xlsx), and our tagging
policy document. Break down costs by team, identify untagged spend, and show
month-over-month trends for the last 3 months.
```

### 2. The agent maps services to teams

The agent cross-references billing line items with your ownership spreadsheet:

```
Service-to-Team Mapping:
- Platform Team: EKS cluster, RDS primary, ElastiCache, CloudFront
- Product Team: 3x ECS services (api, web, worker), S3 media bucket
- Data Team: EMR cluster, Redshift, Glue jobs, S3 data-lake bucket
- Shared: VPC, Route53, CloudWatch, IAM (allocated proportionally)

Untagged Resources (23% of spend):
- 4 EC2 instances (i-0a3f..., i-0b7c...): $1,840/mo — likely staging leftovers
- 2 RDS snapshots older than 90 days: $320/mo
- 1 NAT Gateway in ap-southeast-1: $180/mo — no services in this region
```

### 3. The agent calculates per-team cost allocation

```
January 2026 Cost Allocation:

| Team          | Direct Cost | Shared Cost | Total     | % of Bill | MoM Change |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Platform      | $14,200     | $3,100      | $17,300   | 36.8%     | +4.2%      |
| Product       | $11,800     | $2,900      | $14,700   | 31.3%     | +8.1%      |
| Data          | $9,600      | $2,400      | $12,000   | 25.5%     | +31.2%     |
| Untagged      | $3,000      | —           | $3,000    | 6.4%      | -12.0%     |
| TOTAL         |             |             | $47,000   | 100%      | +11.3%     |

Key finding: Data Team costs jumped 31.2% due to a new EMR cluster
(emr-etl-migration) spun up on Jan 12 that runs 24/7 instead of on-demand.
```

### 4. The agent identifies optimization opportunities

```
Cost Optimization Recommendations:

1. Convert EMR cluster to spot instances + auto-scaling: save ~$2,800/mo
2. Delete 4 untagged EC2 instances (confirmed no traffic in 30 days): save $1,840/mo
3. Move old RDS snapshots to S3 Glacier: save $290/mo
4. Delete unused NAT Gateway in ap-southeast-1: save $180/mo
5. Right-size Product Team ECS tasks (avg CPU util 12%): save ~$1,500/mo

Total potential savings: $6,610/mo (14% of current bill)
```

### 5. The agent generates the monthly report

```
Generated: cost-allocation-january-2026.xlsx

Sheets:
1. Executive Summary — one-page overview with charts
2. Team Breakdown — per-team costs with MoM trends
3. Service Detail — line-item costs by AWS service
4. Untagged Resources — list with suggested owners
5. Optimization Actions — prioritized savings opportunities
6. Tagging Compliance — 77% tagged (up from 60% last month)

Also generated: cost-allocation-january-2026.pdf (for the CFO)
```

## Real-World Example

Marco is the VP of Engineering at a 40-person SaaS startup heading into Series B. Their investor due diligence requires clear unit economics, but the $47,000 monthly cloud bill is a black box.

1. Marco exports three months of AWS Cost and Usage Reports and a spreadsheet listing which team owns which service
2. The agent maps 94% of costs to specific teams and flags $3,000 in orphaned resources
3. It reveals the Data Team's costs spiked 31% from a misconfigured EMR cluster running 24/7
4. The optimization report identifies $6,600/month in easy savings, which Marco's team implements in one sprint
5. Marco presents the cost allocation report to investors, showing clear per-team spend, a downward cost trend, and a plan for sustainable scaling
