# Transform PDF Reports Into Actionable Data and Cut Analysis Time

## The Problem

Every month, Sofia at a 35-person consulting firm receives 12 vendor PDF reports averaging 67 pages each. She needs to extract revenue tables, client metrics, and performance indicators to build her monthly dashboard. Currently, she spends 14 hours manually copying data from PDFs — tables that come out mangled, numbers that misalign, formatting that breaks completely.

The math is brutal: 14 hours × 12 months = 168 hours annually. At Sofia's $75/hour rate, that's $12,600 in labor costs for pure data entry. More painful: the 3-day delay between receiving reports and having usable data means leadership makes decisions on stale information. Critical trends get spotted days late.

PDF complexity compounds the problem. Multi-page tables that split across pages. Merged cells that break extraction. Scanned documents that resist text selection. Tables embedded in charts. 847 individual data points across all reports, each requiring manual verification. Error rate: 12% from copy-paste mistakes, costing 2.3 additional hours monthly in corrections.

## The Solution

Combine **pdf-analyzer** for document extraction, **data-analysis** for pattern recognition, and **excel-processor** for output formatting. The approach: intelligently parse document structure, extract all tabular data, validate accuracy, and deliver analysis-ready datasets.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install pdf-analyzer data-analysis excel-processor
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Bulk document analysis

```
Process all 12 vendor reports in ./monthly-reports/. Extract revenue tables, client metrics, and KPI summaries. Combine into one master dataset.
```

```
ANALYZING 12 PDF REPORTS (804 pages total):

Document Structure Detected:
  Acme_Q3_Report.pdf (67 pages) → 5 tables, 23 KPIs, 1 chart-table
  Beta_Analytics.pdf (52 pages) → 3 tables, 18 KPIs, 2 embedded charts
  Gamma_Insights.pdf (89 pages) → 7 tables, 31 KPIs, split-page table detected
  ... (9 more reports analyzed)

EXTRACTION RESULTS:
  Tables found: 67 (including 14 multi-page)
  Data points: 2,847 (vs 847 manual)
  Accuracy: 97.3% (validated against sample)
  Processing time: 4m 23s (vs 14 hours manual)
```

### 2. Intelligent table extraction

```
Handle complex table structures: merged headers, split pages, embedded subtotals. Clean and normalize all data.
```

```
COMPLEX TABLE PROCESSING:

Multi-page table (Gamma_Insights.pdf, pages 23-26):
  ✓ Detected table continuation across 4 pages
  ✓ Reconstructed headers from page 23
  ✓ Merged 127 rows into continuous dataset
  ✓ Preserved subtotals as calculated fields

Merged cell handling:
  ✓ "Q1 Revenue" spanning 3 columns → split into Q1_Jan, Q1_Feb, Q1_Mar
  ✓ Regional headers spanning 5 rows → applied to all child rows
  ✓ Total rows identified and preserved as separate section

Chart-embedded data extraction:
  ✓ OCR detected numeric values in bar chart (Beta_Analytics.pdf, p34)
  ✓ Extracted: [23.4M, 31.2M, 28.9M, 35.1M] quarterly figures
  ✓ Cross-validated against text references (100% match)
```

### 3. Data quality validation

```
Cross-check extracted numbers against document totals, flag inconsistencies, and verify calculation accuracy.
```

```
DATA VALIDATION RESULTS:

Consistency checks:
  ✓ 847 extracted totals vs stated totals: 843 matches, 4 discrepancies flagged
  ✓ Regional sums vs national totals: 98.7% accuracy
  ✓ Date sequences: All valid, 0 impossible dates
  ✓ Percentage calculations: 23 recalculated, 19 matched, 4 source errors found

Anomaly detection:
  ⚠️  Delta_Corp Q2 revenue: 340% increase (likely typo: $1.2M vs $4.2M)
  ⚠️  Echo_Systems client count: Negative growth (-15 clients) - verify
  ✓  All other metrics within expected ranges

CLEANED DATASET: 2,843 validated data points ready for analysis
```

### 4. Automated analysis and insights

```
Generate executive summary with key trends, outliers, and actionable insights from the combined dataset.
```

```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GENERATED:

Key Trends Identified:
  📈 Revenue Growth: 8 of 12 vendors show YoY growth (avg +23.4%)
  📊 Client Acquisition: Combined +2,847 new clients across portfolio
  🎯 Top Performers: Gamma (+34%), Charlie (+28%), Alpha (+21%)
  ⚠️  Concerns: 3 vendors show declining metrics (require investigation)

Performance Metrics:
  • Total Portfolio Revenue: $127.3M (↑18% YoY)
  • Client Satisfaction: 8.7/10 avg (↑0.4 from last quarter)
  • Cost Per Acquisition: $340 avg (↓12% efficiency gain)

Recommended Actions:
  1. Deep-dive into Delta_Corp anomaly (potential data error)
  2. Replicate Gamma's success model with underperformers
  3. Investigate Echo_Systems client churn root cause
```

### 5. Automated dashboard creation

```
Create an Excel dashboard with pivot tables, charts, and automated monthly update process.
```

```
DASHBOARD CREATED: vendor_analysis_dashboard.xlsx

Sheet Structure:
  1. "Executive Summary" → KPI cards, trend charts, traffic lights
  2. "Revenue Analysis" → Pivot table by vendor/quarter, growth charts
  3. "Client Metrics" → Acquisition/retention rates, satisfaction scores
  4. "Raw Data" → All 2,843 extracted data points, filterable
  5. "Data Sources" → PDF tracking, extraction timestamps

Automation Setup:
  ✓ Monthly refresh macro: Drop new PDFs → Run analysis → Update charts
  ✓ Email alert system: Flag outliers, missing reports, data inconsistencies
  ✓ Version control: Archive previous month's data, track changes

Sofia's new workflow: 20 minutes monthly (vs 14 hours)
```

## Real-World Example

The head of operations at a mid-size property management firm was drowning in landlord reports. 47 properties, monthly PDF statements from each, varying formats from different property management companies. She needed occupancy rates, maintenance costs, and rental income trends — but spent 22 hours monthly extracting data manually.

Monday: pdf-analyzer processed all 47 reports in 6 minutes. Found 187 tables across documents, extracted 4,200+ data points, normalized different date formats and currency representations. Data quality: 96.8% accuracy.

Tuesday: data-analysis identified patterns she'd never spotted manually. Maintenance costs spiked 40% in properties managed by one specific company. Occupancy rates showed seasonal patterns that could optimize lease renewal timing. Three properties had concerning rent collection rates.

Wednesday: excel-processor built an automated dashboard. Property performance scores, maintenance cost trends, occupancy forecasts. Monthly data refresh now takes 15 minutes instead of 22 hours.

Result: 264 hours saved annually ($19,800 in labor costs). More importantly: she caught maintenance issues 2 months earlier, preventing $34,000 in emergency repairs. Data-driven lease pricing increased portfolio revenue by 8.4%.
