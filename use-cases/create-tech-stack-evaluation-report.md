# Create an Automated Tech Stack Evaluation Report with AI

## The Problem

Your team needs to pick a new database, frontend framework, or hosting provider. Everyone has opinions, but nobody has time to do a thorough comparison. The CTO asks for a structured evaluation, and the senior engineer spends a week reading docs, blog posts, and benchmark articles — then produces a Google Doc that's already outdated. Meanwhile, the team argues based on gut feeling rather than data.

## The Solution

Use **web-research** to gather current benchmarks and community sentiment, **competitor-alternatives** to map the landscape, **data-analysis** to score options against your criteria, and **report-generator** to produce a professional evaluation document.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define your evaluation criteria

Tell the agent what you're evaluating and what matters:

> We need to choose a message queue for our event-driven architecture. Compare RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS, and Redis Streams. Our criteria: throughput (>50k msgs/sec), latency (<10ms p99), operational complexity, cost at our scale (500M messages/month), and ecosystem maturity.

### 2. Research each option

The agent searches for recent benchmarks, documentation, pricing pages, and community discussions for each technology:

```text
Research complete. Sources analyzed:
- 12 benchmark articles (2024-2025)
- Official documentation for all 4 options
- 8 production case studies at similar scale
- Pricing calculators for managed offerings
- GitHub activity and Stack Overflow trends
```

### 3. Review the scoring matrix

Tech Stack Evaluation — Message Queue

| Criteria              | Weight | Kafka  | RabbitMQ | SQS    | Redis Streams |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Throughput            | 25%    | 9/10   | 6/10     | 7/10   | 8/10          |
| Latency (p99)        | 20%    | 7/10   | 8/10     | 6/10   | 9/10          |
| Operational cost      | 20%    | 4/10   | 6/10     | 9/10   | 7/10          |
| Monthly cost          | 20%    | $840   | $620     | $1,250 | $480          |
| Ecosystem maturity    | 15%    | 9/10   | 8/10     | 7/10   | 5/10          |
|                       |        |        |          |        |               |
| **Weighted Score**    |        | **7.1**| **6.8**  | **7.2**| **7.2**       |

### 4. Get the detailed recommendation

> Give me the full recommendation with trade-offs for each option and your top pick for our use case.

### 5. Generate the structured report

The agent generates a complete evaluation document with an executive summary, detailed analysis per option, risk assessment, migration considerations, and a final recommendation with reasoning — ready to share with stakeholders.

## Real-World Example

Tomás is the engineering lead at a 30-person e-commerce startup. They've outgrown their PostgreSQL-for-everything architecture and need a dedicated search solution. Using the tech stack evaluation workflow:

1. Tomás asks the agent to compare Elasticsearch, Typesense, Meilisearch, and Algolia for product search with 200k SKUs
2. The agent researches indexing speed, query latency, relevance tuning options, hosting costs, and developer experience for each
3. The scoring matrix shows Typesense leading on cost and simplicity, Elasticsearch on features, and Algolia on managed convenience
4. The final report includes a recommendation to start with Typesense for cost-efficiency, with a migration path to Elasticsearch if advanced features are needed later
5. Tomás presents the report at the architecture review — the team makes a decision in one meeting instead of debating for three weeks

## Tips for Better Evaluations

- **Weight criteria before researching** — deciding what matters after seeing results introduces bias
- **Include operational cost, not just license cost** — a free tool with high maintenance overhead costs more than a paid managed service
- **Check community health** — GitHub stars mean less than recent commit frequency, issue response time, and contributor diversity
- **Test with your actual data** — benchmarks from blog posts rarely match your specific workload
- **Set a decision deadline** — evaluation paralysis is real; time-box the research to one week maximum
- **Document the decision** — future team members will ask "why did we pick this?" and the evaluation report is your answer
