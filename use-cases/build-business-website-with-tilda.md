## The Problem

Marta co-founded a small artisan cosmetics brand with 5 people. She needs a website — homepage, product catalog with a cart, an "About us" page, a blog for SEO, and landing pages for Instagram ad campaigns. The budget doesn't allow a custom-developed site, and nobody on the team writes code. She tried WordPress but got overwhelmed by plugins, security updates, and hosting. She needs something where her team can create and edit pages visually, sell products with payments, and launch new campaign pages in hours, not weeks.

There's no backend to manage. No server. No developer on retainer. Tilda handles hosting, payments, CRM, forms, and analytics — all in one platform.

## The Solution

Use Tilda to build the entire web presence: a multi-page website with Zero Block for custom layouts, Tilda's built-in store for product catalog and checkout, a blog with SEO-optimized posts, and campaign landing pages that the team clones and edits for each promotion. Connect payment processors, set up form-to-CRM automation, and add a custom domain.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Site Structure and Navigation

Plan the site structure in Tilda. Each page is independent — you build it from pre-made blocks or custom Zero Blocks, then link them through the site menu.

The site map for the cosmetics brand:

- **Homepage** — hero, featured products, brand story, testimonials, Instagram feed
- **Catalog** — product grid with filtering by category (skincare, haircare, sets)
- **Product pages** — auto-generated by Tilda Store for each product
- **About** — team photos, brand mission, manufacturing process
- **Blog** — SEO articles about skincare routines, ingredients, seasonal tips
- **Contact** — form with map, working hours, social links
- **Landing pages** — one per campaign (Spring Sale, Holiday Gift Sets, New Launch)

In Tilda, create a new project, then add pages. Set up the site menu in Project Settings → Header so every page shares the same navigation. Tilda generates the menu automatically from page titles, but you can customize the order, group pages into dropdowns, and hide pages (like landing pages) from the main nav.

### Step 2: Build the Homepage with Zero Block

Tilda offers 550+ pre-designed blocks you can drop onto a page. For sections that need pixel-perfect custom layout — like a hero with overlapping elements or an asymmetric grid — use Zero Block, Tilda's visual editor.

**Hero section**: Use Zero Block to create a full-screen hero with:
- Background video or image with overlay
- Animated heading (Tilda has built-in text animations)
- CTA button linking to the catalog
- Scroll indicator

**Featured products**: Use the "Store" block type ST100 or ST200 — it pulls products directly from the Tilda Store catalog. When staff adds a new product, it appears on the homepage automatically.

**Testimonials**: Use block type RE100 (reviews) — staff adds customer quotes, names, and photos through the block editor. No code, just fill in the fields.

**Instagram feed**: Use the built-in "Social Feed" block (SF200) — connect the brand's Instagram account and it displays recent posts automatically.

Each block has settings for colors, spacing, fonts, and animation that staff can change in the visual editor.

### Step 3: Set Up the Tilda Store

Tilda has a built-in e-commerce system — product catalog, cart, checkout, payment processing. No Shopify, no WooCommerce, no plugins.

**Add products** in the Tilda Store dashboard (Project Settings → Store → Products):
- Product title, description, multiple photos
- Variants (size, scent, etc.)
- Price, compare-at price (for sales), SKU
- Categories for filtering
- Digital or physical product toggle
- Stock tracking

**Payment setup**: Connect payment processors directly:
- Stripe (cards worldwide)
- PayPal
- Local processors (depending on country)
- Manual payments (bank transfer, cash on delivery)

Configure in Store Settings → Payment Systems. Enter API keys, enable the ones you need.

**Checkout and delivery**: Tilda generates a checkout flow automatically:
- Cart popup with product list and totals
- Customer info form (name, email, phone, address)
- Delivery options (flat rate, free shipping threshold, pickup)
- Payment step
- Order confirmation with email

Customize the checkout fields — if you sell digital products, hide the address field. If you offer pickup, add a location selector.

**Order management**: Orders appear in the Tilda Store dashboard. Staff sees customer details, order contents, payment status. Export to CSV or connect to a CRM.

### Step 4: Create the Blog for SEO

Tilda's blog system works through the "Blog" page type. Create a blog page, then add posts. Each post is a separate Tilda page with a standard structure.

For SEO, each post needs:
- **Title tag and meta description**: Set in page settings (Page Settings → SEO). Write a unique description under 160 characters.
- **URL slug**: Set a clean URL like `/blog/best-skincare-routine-for-winter`
- **Heading structure**: Use H1 for the post title (one per page), H2 for sections, H3 for subsections. Tilda blocks have heading level settings.
- **Images with alt text**: Every image block has an "Alt text" field. Describe the image for accessibility and SEO.
- **Internal links**: Link to product pages and other blog posts. Tilda's link dialog lets you pick pages from the project.

Blog post template that staff clones for each new article:
1. Cover image block (CR100) with title overlay
2. Text block with intro paragraph
3. Image-text blocks alternating (columns layout)
4. Product recommendation block (link to catalog)
5. CTA block (subscribe to newsletter)

Staff creates a new post by duplicating the template page, replacing the content, and publishing. No CMS backend, no WordPress editor — just the same visual blocks they use everywhere.

### Step 5: Campaign Landing Pages

This is where Tilda really shines for a marketing team. Creating a landing page for an Instagram ad campaign:

1. **Duplicate a template**: Copy an existing landing page and rename it
2. **Customize**: Swap images, update copy, change the offer
3. **Set a clean URL**: `/spring-sale-2026`
4. **Hide from menu**: Landing pages shouldn't appear in the site navigation
5. **Add tracking**: In page settings, paste the Facebook Pixel and Google Analytics IDs
6. **Connect forms**: Any lead capture form sends data to Tilda CRM, or forward to Google Sheets / email / webhook
7. **Publish**: One click

The landing page structure for a seasonal sale:

- Zero Block hero with countdown timer (built-in element in Zero Block)
- Product grid filtered to sale items (Store block with category filter)
- Social proof — reviews, Instagram posts
- FAQ section (accordion block)
- Final CTA with urgency ("Ends March 1st")

Each campaign gets its own page. After the campaign, unpublish or redirect — no cleanup needed.

### Step 6: Forms, CRM, and Automations

Every form in Tilda can trigger automations:

**Newsletter signup**: Form block → sends to Mailchimp/Brevo/SendPulse via built-in integrations. No API setup — just enter the account API key in the form's "Data" settings.

**Contact form**: Form → email notification to the team + save to Tilda CRM. Add a webhook to push to Slack or Telegram for instant notifications.

**Lead capture on landing pages**: Form → Tilda CRM + Google Sheets (for the marketing team to track) + email autoresponder.

Configure all of this in the form block settings — no code, no Zapier, no external tools. Tilda has built-in connectors for the most common services.

### Step 7: Custom Domain and Analytics

**Domain**: In Project Settings → Domain, point your custom domain. Tilda provides free SSL. DNS setup: add a CNAME record pointing to `tilda.ws` or an A record to Tilda's IP.

**Analytics**: In Project Settings → Analytics, add:
- Google Analytics 4 (measurement ID)
- Facebook Pixel (for ad campaigns)
- Any custom script (via the "HTML before </head>" field)

Tilda also has built-in analytics — page views, form submissions, and store orders — visible in the dashboard without any external tools.

## The Outcome

Marta's team runs the entire website without a developer. Adding a new product: open Store dashboard, fill in the fields, upload photos, set the price, publish — 10 minutes. Writing a blog post: duplicate the template, replace content, publish — 30 minutes. Launching an Instagram ad campaign with a dedicated landing page: clone the template, customize, set the tracking pixel, publish — 1 hour.

The site handles everything: product catalog with cart and payments, blog for organic search traffic, campaign landing pages for paid traffic, contact forms that feed into the CRM. Total cost: Tilda Business plan ($25/month) + domain ($15/year). No hosting fees, no security patches, no plugin updates, no developer retainer. The team focuses on products and marketing instead of website maintenance.
