# Launch a SaaS Product to Market

## The Problem

You have built a working SaaS product and need to launch it. But "launching" is not a single event -- it is a sequence of positioning, pricing, channel selection, and timing decisions that compound on each other. Get the pricing wrong and your best launch day traffic converts at $0. Position the product poorly and journalists ignore your pitch. Launch without a plan and you get a brief spike followed by silence.

Most founders either over-engineer the launch (spending months on a perfect plan that never ships) or under-plan it (tweeting "we're live!" to 200 followers and calling it a day). Neither approach works. A successful launch requires clear positioning, validated pricing, and coordinated execution across multiple channels within a tight window.

## The Solution

Combine **launch-strategy** to build a phased launch plan with timeline and channel tactics, **pricing-strategy** to model tiers and validate willingness-to-pay before launch day, and **product-marketing-context** to define positioning, ICP, and competitive differentiation that anchors all launch messaging.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define positioning and ideal customer profile

Start by establishing who the product is for and why they should care. This grounds every downstream decision.

> Analyze our product (an AI meeting note-taker for sales teams) and define our positioning, ICP, and key differentiators versus Otter.ai, Fireflies, and Grain.

The agent produces a positioning document with a one-line value prop, three ICP segments ranked by fit, a competitive matrix showing feature gaps you win on, and messaging pillars for each segment.

### 2. Model and validate pricing tiers

Before launch, pricing needs to be locked. Guessing leads to leaving money on the table or scaring off early adopters.

> Design pricing tiers for our meeting note-taker. Our competitors charge $16-30/user/month. We want a free tier for virality and a team tier for revenue. Model expected revenue at 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 users.

The agent produces a three-tier pricing model (Free, Pro at $19/user/month, Team at $29/user/month) with feature gates, projected conversion rates between tiers, and revenue curves at each user milestone.

### 3. Build the phased launch plan

A launch is not one day -- it is a pre-launch, launch day, and post-launch sequence spanning 4-6 weeks.

> Create a 6-week launch plan. We have a 400-person waitlist, $2,000 budget, and access to 3 podcast hosts in the sales tech space. Target: 500 signups in week one.

The agent delivers a week-by-week calendar with projected reach at each phase:

```text
6-WEEK LAUNCH PLAN
====================

PHASE 1: PRE-LAUNCH (Weeks 1-3)
  Week 1  Send waitlist teaser email #1 ("something is coming")
          Expected: 62% open rate, build anticipation
  Week 2  Send waitlist email #2 (early access offer for referrals)
          Expected: 40-80 referral signups from 400-person list
  Week 3  Record 3 podcast episodes (air dates: weeks 4-6)
          Draft Product Hunt listing, recruit 20 upvoters

PHASE 2: LAUNCH (Week 4)
  Tuesday  Product Hunt submission at 12:01 AM PT
           Waitlist email #3 ("we are live — get your early access")
           Twitter thread + LinkedIn post
           Budget: $800 on targeted Twitter ads to PH listing
           Target: 300-500 signups on day one

PHASE 3: POST-LAUNCH (Weeks 5-6)
  Week 5  Podcast episode #1 airs, Hacker News Show HN post
          Budget: $1,200 on retargeting ads to PH and HN visitors
  Week 6  Podcast episodes #2-3 air, case study from early users
          Email sequence to convert free signups to paid
```

Each tactic includes expected reach, conversion estimates, and dependencies. The plan front-loads waitlist activation so launch day has built-in momentum rather than starting from zero.

### 4. Prepare launch day assets and messaging

With positioning locked and the plan built, generate all the assets needed for execution.

> Generate our Product Hunt listing copy, launch day email to the waitlist, Twitter thread announcing the launch, and a press pitch for TechCrunch and The Information.

The agent produces each asset using the positioning and ICP from step one, ensuring consistent messaging across every channel. The Product Hunt tagline emphasizes the core differentiator. The press pitch leads with a market trend, not a feature list.

## Real-World Example

Anya built an AI meeting note-taker for sales teams and had been "about to launch" for two months. She had a 400-person waitlist but no launch plan, no pricing page, and no press strategy. She ran the three-skill workflow on a Monday. The positioning exercise revealed her strongest differentiator was not transcription accuracy (where Otter.ai dominates) but automatic CRM field population -- something no competitor offered. That insight reshaped her entire launch angle.

The pricing model settled on Free (5 meetings/month), Pro ($19/user), and Team ($29/user with Salesforce integration). The launch plan targeted Product Hunt on a Tuesday (historically the best day for B2B tools) with a coordinated email blast and three podcast appearances scheduled the same week. Launch day brought 847 signups -- 347 above target. The Product Hunt listing finished #4 of the day. Within 30 days, 62 users had converted to Pro, generating $1,178 in MRR from a product that had zero revenue six weeks earlier.
