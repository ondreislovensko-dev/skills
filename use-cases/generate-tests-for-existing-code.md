# Generate Tests for Existing Code with AI

## The Problem

You inherited a 40,000-line Node.js codebase with exactly zero tests. The previous team shipped fast and left testing as a "future task." Now every deployment is a coin flip. Last month, a one-line change in the payment module broke checkout for 2,300 users during peak hours — 4 hours to detect, 2 to roll back.

Writing tests retroactively is brutal. Each module takes 2-3 hours to understand, mock dependencies, and cover edge cases. With 85 modules, that's 170-255 hours — over a month of full-time effort for one engineer. Meanwhile, features keep shipping untested because the backlog never shrinks.

The real cost isn't just engineering time. It's the 3 AM pages, the customer churn from broken features, and the slow erosion of team confidence. SOC 2 auditors are coming in 60 days and they want evidence of automated testing. You need coverage fast.

## The Solution

The **test-generator** skill analyzes your codebase structure, identifies untested modules ranked by risk and usage frequency, then generates comprehensive test suites with realistic edge cases. It reads your existing patterns — error handling, libraries, module interactions — and produces tests that match your codebase style, with proper mocking and async handling.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install test-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Scan for untested modules

```
Analyze this project for test coverage gaps. Prioritize modules by risk — focus on payment, auth, and data processing first.
```

```
Coverage Analysis — 0% overall

HIGH RISK (no tests, high usage):
  1. src/services/payment.js  — 342 lines, 14 imports, Stripe webhooks
  2. src/services/auth.js     — 218 lines, JWT + session management
  3. src/middleware/validation.js — 156 lines, used in 23 routes

Recommended order: payment → auth → validation → notifications → transforms
Estimated generation time: ~15 minutes for all 6 priority modules
```

### 2. Generate tests for the highest-risk module

```
Generate a complete test suite for src/services/payment.js with edge cases for webhook validation, partial refunds, and currency conversion.
```

```
Created: tests/services/payment.test.js (287 lines)

  ✓ processPayment — 8 tests (success, insufficient funds, timeout, duplicate detection)
  ✓ handleWebhook — 6 tests (valid signature, expired, replay attack, malformed payload)
  ✓ processRefund — 5 tests (full, partial, exceeds charge, already refunded)
  ✓ convertCurrency — 4 tests (standard, same currency no-op, unsupported, stale rate)

Mocked: stripe SDK, redis cache, logger
All 23 tests passing ✓
```

### 3. Batch-generate for remaining modules

```
Generate test suites for auth.js, validation.js, notifications.js, transforms.js, and inventory.js. Run each suite after generation.
```

```
tests/services/auth.test.js         — 19 tests, all passing ✓
tests/middleware/validation.test.js  — 15 tests, all passing ✓
tests/services/notifications.test.js — 12 tests, all passing ✓
tests/utils/transforms.test.js      — 9 tests, all passing ✓
tests/services/inventory.test.js     — 16 tests, all passing ✓

Total: 94 tests across 6 modules
Coverage: 0% → 47% (statements), 52% (branches)
Time elapsed: 11 minutes
```

### 4. Fix failures and reach 70% coverage

```
Run the full suite, fix any failures, then add targeted tests to reach 70% coverage.
```

```
94 tests — 91 passing, 3 failing

Fixes applied:
  ✗ auth.test.js:45 — token expiry mock wrong timezone → fixed
  ✗ inventory.test.js:78 — race condition in stock reservation → added mutex mock
  ✗ notifications.test.js:33 — SMS provider error format changed → updated assertion

Adding targeted tests for uncovered branches...
  + 18 error handling paths, + 7 config edge cases, + 4 rate limiting tests

Final: 123 tests, all passing. Coverage: 72% statements, 68% branches ✓
```

### 5. Set up CI coverage gates

```
Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every PR and blocks merges below 70% coverage.
```

```
Created: .github/workflows/test.yml
  - Runs on: push to main, all PRs
  - Services: PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7
  - Coverage threshold: 70% (fails PR if below)
  - Report: uploads coverage diff as PR comment
```

## Real-World Example

A senior backend engineer at a 30-person fintech startup joined three months before their SOC 2 Type II audit. The 60,000-line Node.js API had zero automated tests — built by contractors over 18 months. Auditors needed evidence of systematic testing practices.

He started with the test-generator skill on Monday, targeting the transaction processing pipeline. By lunch, the agent had generated 156 tests across 8 modules. Three tests failed due to timezone-dependent comparisons — fixed in under a minute. By Wednesday, he had 340 tests covering 22 core modules at 74% statement coverage. Thursday, he reviewed generated tests and added 15 business-logic-specific assertions. Friday, the CI pipeline with coverage gates was live.

The SOC 2 auditors reviewed the testing infrastructure two weeks later. The automated suite, CI pipeline, and coverage reports satisfied change management and QA controls. The startup passed without findings in the testing category — saving an estimated $45,000 in remediation costs and avoiding a 3-month delay on their enterprise sales pipeline.
