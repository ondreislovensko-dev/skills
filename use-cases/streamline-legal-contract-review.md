# Streamline Legal Contract Review

## The Problem

A growing SaaS company signs 15-20 vendor and partnership contracts per month. The legal team of two attorneys reviews every contract manually, spending 3-4 hours per agreement reading through 20-40 pages of legal language to find problematic clauses. They maintain a checklist of 28 standard terms the company requires (liability caps, indemnification limits, data processing addenda, SLA guarantees), but checking each contract against this list is tedious and error-prone.

Last quarter, a vendor contract went through without a data processing addendum, which only surfaced during a SOC 2 audit. The auditor flagged it as a finding that required a 30-day remediation window and an uncomfortable conversation with the vendor's legal team.

## The Solution

Use the **contract-review** skill to automatically analyze contracts against the company's standard terms, flag risky or non-standard clauses, compare key terms across similar agreements, and generate concise review summaries that highlight what needs negotiation.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Analyze a contract against company standards

Review a new vendor agreement against the company's required terms checklist:

> Review the attached Master Service Agreement from CloudVault Inc (data backup vendor). Check against our standard requirements: liability cap must not exceed 12 months of fees paid, indemnification must be mutual, termination for convenience requires 30 days notice or less, auto-renewal period must not exceed 1 year, data processing addendum must be included, SLA must guarantee 99.9% uptime, data residency must be US or EU only, intellectual property clause must not include work product assignment, non-compete must not exceed the term of the agreement, and governing law must be Delaware or New York. For each requirement, report whether the contract complies, does not comply, or does not address the term.

A "does not address" result is often more dangerous than "does not comply." A missing data processing addendum means the contract says nothing about how the vendor handles your data, which is a compliance gap, not just a negotiation point.

### 2. Identify high-risk clauses

Flag specific language that exposes the company to outsized liability or unfavorable terms:

> Scan the CloudVault MSA for high-risk clauses. Flag any of the following: unlimited liability provisions, unilateral amendment rights (vendor can change terms without consent), broad intellectual property assignments, non-standard force majeure definitions that include economic downturns or supply chain issues, automatic price escalation exceeding 5% annually, audit rights that require less than 15 days notice, and data breach notification timelines longer than 72 hours. For each flagged clause, quote the specific language and explain the risk in one sentence.

High-risk clauses often hide in definitions sections or buried in appendices. Unilateral amendment rights are particularly common in SaaS vendor contracts and effectively let the vendor change any term at any time.

### 3. Compare terms across similar vendor agreements

Benchmark this contract against other data vendor agreements the company has signed:

> Compare the CloudVault MSA terms against our existing agreements with BackupHero (signed June 2025) and DataSafe Corp (signed September 2025). Create a comparison table covering: annual contract value, liability cap as percentage of contract value, SLA uptime guarantee, data breach notification timeline, termination notice period, auto-renewal terms, and data processing scope. Highlight where CloudVault's terms are less favorable than our existing vendors and suggest which terms to negotiate based on the better precedents we already have.

Comparing against existing agreements gives the attorney leverage: "Our other data vendors accepted mutual indemnification, so we expect the same from CloudVault." Precedent-based negotiation is faster and more effective than arguing from first principles.

### 4. Generate a redline summary for negotiation

Produce a concise summary document the attorney can use in negotiation:

> Generate a redline summary for the CloudVault MSA negotiation. For each non-compliant or high-risk clause, list: the section number, the current language (summarized), our required standard, and suggested replacement language. Prioritize the items: mark data processing addendum and liability cap as "must negotiate" and items like governing law preference as "nice to have". Format as a one-page table the attorney can bring to the negotiation call.

Separating "must negotiate" from "nice to have" items prevents negotiation fatigue. Leading with 3-4 firm requirements and having 2-3 flexible items to concede keeps the conversation productive and closes deals faster.

### 5. Track contract review status and outstanding items

Maintain a review log across all active contract negotiations:

> Update the contract review tracker with the CloudVault MSA status. Current pipeline: CloudVault MSA (under review, 4 items flagged for negotiation), Pinnacle Analytics renewal (redlines sent, awaiting response), Harbor Consulting SOW (approved, pending signature), and TechFlow API license (new, not yet reviewed). For each contract, show: vendor name, contract type, total value, review status, number of flagged items, and days since receipt. Flag any contracts that have been in review for more than 10 business days.

The tracker prevents contracts from stalling in the pipeline. A 10-day aging alert catches agreements that have fallen through the cracks, which is common when the legal team juggles 15-20 active reviews.

## Real-World Example

The legal team receives the CloudVault MSA on a Tuesday. Within an hour, the automated review identifies 6 non-compliant terms: no data processing addendum (critical gap), unlimited liability on the vendor's side but capped for the company (unfair), auto-renewal of 3 years (too long), price escalation of 8% annually (above threshold), data breach notification in 30 days (should be 72 hours), and governing law set to California (preference is Delaware). The comparison against BackupHero and DataSafe shows that both existing vendors accepted mutual liability caps and 72-hour breach notification.

The attorney walks into the Thursday negotiation call with a one-page redline and closes the contract by Friday with all critical items resolved. The data processing addendum is added, liability is capped at 12 months of fees, auto-renewal is reduced to 1 year, and breach notification is set to 72 hours. The two "nice to have" items (governing law and price escalation) are conceded as negotiation leverage. What previously took a full week of back-and-forth now takes three days from receipt to signature.
