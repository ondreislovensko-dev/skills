# Automate Meeting Capture and Follow-Up

## The Problem

An engineering manager attends 12-15 meetings per week across standups, sprint planning, 1:1s, and cross-functional syncs. They take notes by hand during meetings, but the notes are incomplete because they cannot listen and write simultaneously. Action items get buried in paragraphs of text.

Follow-up emails are often sent the next day because distilling meeting notes into a coherent summary takes 15-20 minutes per meeting. Two weeks ago, a critical decision from a product review meeting was lost because the manager's notes said "discussed pricing" with no details about what was actually decided. The team revisited the same discussion the following week, wasting an hour of four people's time.

## The Solution

Use the **voice-to-text** skill to transcribe meeting recordings into accurate text, and the **meeting-notes** skill to structure transcriptions into organized notes with extracted decisions, action items, and follow-up drafts.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Transcribe the meeting recording

Convert a recorded meeting into timestamped, speaker-attributed text:

> Transcribe the recording from today's product review meeting (product-review-2026-02-19.m4a, 47 minutes). Identify and label speakers: Sarah (PM), Marcus (Engineering Lead), Diane (Design), and James (VP Product). Include timestamps every 2 minutes. Handle technical terminology accurately, especially product names like "DataFlow", "QueryEngine", and "InsightsDashboard". Output as a clean transcript with speaker labels and paragraph breaks at topic changes.

Speaker attribution is essential for action item extraction. When someone says "I will have that ready by Friday," the transcript needs to record who said it. Providing speaker names upfront improves attribution accuracy significantly.

### 2. Generate structured meeting notes

Extract key content from the transcript into an organized summary:

> Process the product review transcript and generate structured meeting notes. Include these sections: Meeting Metadata (date, attendees, duration), Key Discussion Points (3-5 bullet points summarizing main topics), Decisions Made (explicit decisions with who made them and the reasoning), Action Items (who, what, due date), Open Questions (unresolved items that need follow-up), and Parking Lot (topics raised but deferred). For the pricing discussion, capture the specific decision: James approved the 15% price increase for the Enterprise tier effective April 1, conditional on adding the SSO feature by March 15.

The "Decisions Made" section is the most valuable part. Many meetings result in decisions that are never recorded, leading to revisited discussions weeks later. Capturing the decision, who made it, and the conditions prevents this loop.

### 3. Extract and assign action items

Pull every commitment from the meeting into a trackable task list:

> Extract all action items from the product review meeting notes. For each item, identify: the owner (who volunteered or was assigned), the specific deliverable, the deadline (stated or implied), and the priority (based on discussion urgency). From this meeting, I expect items like: Marcus to deliver SSO implementation plan by February 24, Diane to update the pricing page mockups by February 21, Sarah to draft customer communication about the price change by February 26, and James to approve the updated enterprise feature comparison by March 1. Format as a table with columns: Owner, Task, Due Date, Priority, Meeting Source.

Implicit deadlines need explicit dates. When someone says "I will get to that next week," the action item should specify an actual date. Vague commitments are the primary reason action items slip through the cracks.

### 4. Draft follow-up emails for meeting attendees

Generate the post-meeting email that goes to all participants and stakeholders:

> Draft a follow-up email from the product review meeting to send to all attendees plus the sales team leads (Tom and Rachel, who were not in the meeting but are affected by the pricing decision). Include a 3-sentence executive summary at the top, the key decisions, each person's action items highlighted under their name, and the next meeting date (March 5). Keep the email concise, under 250 words. Use a professional but direct tone. Add a note at the bottom asking recipients to reply within 24 hours if any action item is incorrect or missing.

Sending follow-up emails within an hour of the meeting has a measurable effect. Attendees can correct misunderstood action items while the conversation is fresh, and stakeholders who were not present get context before they hear about decisions secondhand.

### 5. Process a week of meeting recordings in batch

Transcribe and summarize multiple meetings at once for the weekly review:

> Process all 5 meeting recordings from this week: Monday standup (12 min), Tuesday 1:1 with Marcus (30 min), Wednesday cross-functional sync (45 min), Thursday sprint planning (60 min), and Friday retrospective (25 min). For each, generate the standard structured notes. Then create a weekly summary document that consolidates: all action items across meetings grouped by owner, all decisions made this week, recurring themes or concerns that appeared in multiple meetings, and any conflicting commitments (same person assigned work with overlapping deadlines).

The weekly consolidation catches a common problem: the same person gets assigned work in three different meetings without anyone tracking the cumulative load. Surfacing conflicts early prevents Friday surprises.

## Real-World Example

On Wednesday, the engineering manager records a 47-minute product review with 4 participants. Instead of spending the meeting scribbling notes and missing context, they participate fully in the discussion. After the meeting, the recording is transcribed with speaker labels in 3 minutes. The structured notes correctly capture that James approved the Enterprise pricing increase with the SSO condition, which the manager's handwritten notes would have recorded as "pricing discussed, James OK."

The action items pull out 4 commitments with owners and deadlines. The follow-up email goes out 20 minutes after the meeting instead of the next morning. At the end of the week, the batch summary reveals that Marcus has been assigned work from 3 different meetings with deadlines that overlap on February 28, prompting a reprioritization conversation before the conflict becomes a missed deadline. The manager estimates they save 5 hours per week on note-taking, follow-up drafting, and action item tracking.
