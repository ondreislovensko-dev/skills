# Build a Knowledge Base from Slack and Chat History

## The Problem

Your 25-person engineering team has been using Slack for 3 years. Somewhere in those 140,000 messages are the answers to every recurring question: why the billing service uses a separate database, how to configure the staging VPN, what the workaround is for that OAuth edge case. But nobody can find anything.

Engineers spend 20-30 minutes per day searching Slack for answers that were already given months ago. The same questions get asked every few weeks — "How do I connect to the staging DB?" has been answered 11 times across 3 channels. When someone leaves, their knowledge disappears into an archive nobody reads.

You tried a wiki, but it went stale in 2 months. The problem isn't the wiki — it's that nobody has time to write articles from scratch. The knowledge already exists, scattered across thousands of messages.

## The Solution

Use **data-extractor** to parse and filter chat exports for high-value content, **web-scraper** to pull in linked resources referenced in conversations, and **markdown-writer** to organize everything into a structured, searchable knowledge base.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install data-extractor web-scraper markdown-writer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Export and analyze chat history

```text
Parse our Slack export (slack-export.zip). Identify the highest-value messages: solutions to problems, architectural decisions, config explanations, and how-to threads.
```

```text
ANALYZED: 143,291 messages across 47 channels (Jan 2023 - Feb 2026)

HIGH-VALUE CONTENT:
  Problem/solution threads: 342
  Architecture decisions: 89
  How-to explanations: 156
  Config/setup guides: 78

TOP CHANNELS: #engineering (127), #incidents (84), #devops (63), #help (68)
```

### 2. Extract and deduplicate knowledge

```text
Extract the top knowledge threads. Deduplicate — if the same question was answered multiple times, keep the most complete answer. Group by topic.
```

```text
EXTRACTED 412 unique knowledge items, grouped:

Infrastructure & DevOps (94 items)
  - Database connections, VPN setup, deploy procedures, Docker configs

Application Architecture (67 items)
  - Service boundaries, API design decisions, data model choices

Debugging & Troubleshooting (118 items)
  - Common errors with solutions, performance fixes, third-party quirks

Onboarding & Setup (53 items)
  - Environment setup, tool configs, access requests

Business Logic (80 items)
  - Billing rules, compliance requirements, feature specifications

DEDUPLICATED: Merged 47 duplicate Q&A threads into single authoritative answers
```

### 3. Generate knowledge base articles

```text
Convert the extracted threads into structured knowledge base articles. Each should have a clear title, context, solution, and last-verified date.
```

```text
Generated 412 articles in docs/knowledge-base/:

  infrastructure/connect-to-staging-database.md
    Q: How do I connect to the staging database?
    A: Use the VPN first (see vpn-setup.md), then:
       psql "postgresql://readonly:$STAGING_DB_PASS@staging-db:5432/app"
    Source: #devops, confirmed by 3 engineers | Last verified: 2026-01

  architecture/why-billing-has-separate-db.md
    Q: Why does billing use a separate PostgreSQL instance?
    A: Isolation for PCI compliance. Billing data can't share a database
       with user-generated content per our compliance requirements.
    Source: #engineering, decided 2024-03 | Decision by: CTO + lead

  debugging/oauth-refresh-token-race-condition.md
    Q: Users randomly get logged out mid-session
    A: Race condition in refresh token rotation. Two concurrent requests
       both try to rotate → one gets invalidated. Fix: add mutex lock.
    Source: #incidents, resolved 2025-08 | PR #847
```

### 4. Build the search index and navigation

```text
Create a table of contents, tag index, and search-friendly structure. Add cross-references between related articles.
```

```text
docs/knowledge-base/
  README.md — Table of contents with 5 categories, 412 articles
  _tags.md — Tag index: 34 tags, most used: "database" (41), "auth" (28)

Cross-references added:
  connect-to-staging-database.md → links to vpn-setup.md, database-credentials.md
  oauth-refresh-token-race-condition.md → links to auth-architecture.md

Search: articles use consistent frontmatter (title, tags, date, source)
  Compatible with GitHub search, Docusaurus, or any static site generator
```

### 5. Set up continuous knowledge capture

```text
Create a Slack workflow that lets engineers flag messages as "knowledge" and automatically adds them to the base.
```

```text
Workflow created:
  1. React with :brain: emoji on any valuable Slack message
  2. Bot collects the thread, asks for a one-line summary
  3. Creates a draft article in docs/knowledge-base/inbox/
  4. Weekly: review inbox, approve or edit, merge to main

Also: monthly report of most-searched-but-missing topics
```

## Real-World Example

Priya, a staff engineer at a 30-person healthtech startup, noticed her team was spending more time searching Slack than writing code. She exported 3 years of chat history and ran the extraction workflow. The data-extractor identified 342 problem-solution threads — including the staging database question that had been answered 11 separate times.

The markdown-writer produced 412 articles organized into 5 categories. She deployed them as a Docusaurus site on the internal network. Within the first week, the #help channel volume dropped 35%. New hires started finding answers themselves instead of waiting for someone to respond. After 2 months, the knowledge base had grown to 480 articles as engineers used the :brain: emoji workflow to capture new knowledge in real time.
