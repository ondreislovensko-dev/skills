# Build a WhatsApp Customer Service Bot That Handles 80% of Inquiries

## The Problem

An e-commerce company with 5,000 monthly orders gets 200+ WhatsApp messages daily from customers. Three support agents spend their entire day answering the same questions: "Where is my order?" (45%), "How do I return this?" (20%), "Do you have this in stock?" (15%), and "What are your business hours?" (10%). Only 10% of inquiries actually need a human. Agents burn out, response times average 4 hours, and customers who do not get a quick reply abandon their carts.

## The Solution

Use `whatsapp-bot-builder` to create a WhatsApp Cloud API bot with interactive menus, `coding-agent` to build the order lookup and FAQ engine, and `template-engine` to manage message templates for outbound notifications.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install whatsapp-bot-builder coding-agent template-engine
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Set up the WhatsApp Cloud API and welcome flow

```
Set up a WhatsApp Business API bot using the Meta Cloud API. When a customer
sends any message, respond with a welcome message and an interactive button
menu:

"Hi! 👋 I'm the assistant for [store]. How can I help?"
Buttons: [📦 Track Order] [↩️ Returns] [💬 Talk to Agent]

If they haven't messaged in 24+ hours (outside the reply window), send
the approved "welcome_back" template message instead. Store conversation
state in Redis with a 24-hour TTL matching the WhatsApp conversation window.
```

The agent scaffolds a Node.js Express server with webhook verification, message routing based on conversation state, interactive button responses, and Redis-based session management. It includes the template message fallback logic for expired conversation windows.

### 2. Build the order tracking flow

```
When the customer taps "Track Order", start a conversation flow:
1. Ask for order number or email address
2. Look up the order in the database (query by order number or last order by email)
3. Return: order status, items, tracking number with carrier link, estimated delivery
4. If order is "shipped", show a button: [📍 Track on Map]
5. If order is "processing", show: [⏰ Notify When Shipped]
6. If no order found, offer to connect with an agent

Handle typos in order numbers — suggest closest matches if the format looks right
but the exact number isn't found.
```

The agent implements fuzzy order lookup with Levenshtein distance for typo correction, formatted order status messages with emoji indicators per stage (🟡 Processing → 📦 Shipped → 🚚 Out for Delivery → ✅ Delivered), tracking links as URL buttons, and a notification subscription that triggers a template message when the status changes.

### 3. Automate returns and FAQ

```
Build the returns flow:
1. Ask for order number
2. Show order items as a numbered list — customer selects which item to return
3. Ask for return reason (interactive list: Wrong size, Defective, Changed mind, Other)
4. If "Defective" — ask for a photo (handle image message type)
5. Generate a return label (PDF) and send as a document
6. Confirm return with estimated refund timeline

Also build an FAQ handler: if the customer types a free-text question (not a button),
use keyword matching to detect common questions (shipping times, payment methods,
business hours, sizing guide) and respond with the right answer. If no match,
offer the agent handoff button.
```

The agent creates a multi-step return conversation with item selection via interactive lists, image handling for defective items, PDF generation for return labels, and a keyword-based FAQ engine matching against 20 common questions with fuzzy string matching. Unmatched questions get escalated with the original message preserved for the agent.

### 4. Implement human agent handoff

```
When a customer needs a human agent:
1. Add them to a queue with their conversation history
2. Notify the support team group: "New customer waiting — [name], topic: [returns],
   wait time: ~3 min"
3. An agent claims the conversation by reacting or clicking
4. Bridge messages: customer messages go to the agent's chat, agent replies go back
   to the customer's WhatsApp
5. When the agent sends /close, end the conversation, ask the customer to rate
   the experience (1-5 stars via buttons), and log the session

Show queue position to waiting customers: "You're #2 in line, estimated wait: 5 min"
```

The agent builds a queue system with real-time position updates, agent claiming via a Slack or Telegram notification (configurable), bidirectional message bridging, session logging with conversation transcript, and a CSAT rating collection at the end.

### 5. Set up proactive notifications with templates

```
Create approved WhatsApp template messages for:
1. Order confirmation: "Your order {{1}} for {{2}} has been confirmed. Track: {{3}}"
2. Shipping notification: "Great news! Order {{1}} has shipped. Track here: {{2}}"
3. Delivery confirmation: "Your order {{1}} has been delivered. Happy? Rate us: {{2}}"
4. Abandoned cart reminder: "Hey {{1}}, you left items in your cart. Complete your order: {{2}}"
5. Back in stock: "{{1}} is back in stock! Get it before it's gone: {{2}}"

Build a notification service that triggers these based on order status changes
and cart events. Respect opt-in/opt-out preferences. Include rate limiting
to stay within WhatsApp's messaging tier limits.
```

The agent generates template message definitions ready for Meta approval, a notification dispatcher that maps order events to templates, opt-in/opt-out management with a database table, and rate limiting that tracks the current messaging tier (250/1K/10K/100K conversations per day) and queues excess messages.

## Real-World Example

An e-commerce store owner processes 5,000 orders monthly with 3 support agents drowning in 200+ WhatsApp messages per day. Response time averages 4 hours, and 15% of customers churn after a bad support experience.

1. She deploys the WhatsApp bot — order tracking queries get instant responses, eliminating 45% of agent workload on day one
2. The automated returns flow handles 80% of return requests without human intervention
3. FAQ matching catches another 25% of common questions (business hours, sizing, payments)
4. Agents now only handle complex issues — their queue drops from 200 to 30 messages per day
5. After 2 months: average response time drops from 4 hours to 30 seconds for automated queries and 15 minutes for agent-handled ones. Customer satisfaction scores improve from 3.2 to 4.6. The team considers reducing to 2 agents.
