# Plan Multi-Region Deployment Strategy with AI

## The Problem

Your application serves users across three continents, but everything runs in us-east-1. European users experience 200ms+ latency on every API call, your Australian customers complain about slow page loads, and a single-region outage last quarter took your entire product offline for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, a new enterprise client in Germany requires data residency within the EU. You need multi-region, but the complexity — database replication, routing, deployment coordination, and data sovereignty — feels overwhelming for a 15-person team.

## The Solution

Use the **coding-agent** to design the architecture and generate infrastructure-as-code, **docker-helper** to containerize services for portable deployment, and **hetzner-cloud** to provision and configure servers across regions cost-effectively.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install coding-agent docker-helper hetzner-cloud
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Describe your requirements and constraints

```
We run a Next.js frontend and Express API with Postgres. Currently single-region
in US East. We need to expand to Europe (Frankfurt) and Asia (Singapore) for:
- Lower latency for global users
- EU data residency for GDPR compliance
- High availability (survive a full region outage)
Our budget for infrastructure is $2,000/month. Help me plan this.
```

### 2. The agent designs the multi-region architecture

```
Multi-Region Architecture Plan:

Topology: Active-Active (US + EU), Read Replica (Asia)

US East (Primary):
- 2x CX41 (API servers, load balanced)
- Postgres primary (CPX41 + 200GB volume)
- Redis primary

EU Frankfurt:
- 2x CX41 (API servers, load balanced)
- Postgres replica with promotion capability
- Redis replica
- EU user data stays in this region (GDPR)

Asia Singapore:
- 1x CX31 (API server)
- Postgres read replica
- Redis cache (local)

Routing: Cloudflare DNS with latency-based routing
Estimated cost: $1,740/month
```

### 3. The agent generates infrastructure-as-code

```
Generated Terraform configuration:

terraform/
├── modules/
│   ├── region/          # Reusable per-region module
│   ├── database/        # Postgres with replication
│   └── networking/      # VPC, firewall rules, VPN mesh
├── environments/
│   ├── us-east.tf       # Primary region config
│   ├── eu-frankfurt.tf  # EU region config
│   └── ap-singapore.tf  # Asia region config
├── dns.tf               # Cloudflare latency-based routing
└── variables.tf

Key decisions:
- WireGuard mesh VPN between regions for database replication
- Connection pooling via PgBouncer to handle cross-region connections
- Deployment uses blue-green per region with health checks
```

### 4. The agent creates deployment orchestration

```
Deployment Strategy: Rolling region-by-region

deploy.sh workflow:
1. Deploy to Asia (lowest traffic) → run smoke tests
2. Deploy to EU → run smoke tests + check replication lag
3. Deploy to US (primary) → run full integration tests
4. If any region fails: automatic rollback of that region only

Health check endpoints added:
- /health/basic  → app is running
- /health/db     → database connection + replication lag < 500ms
- /health/full   → all dependencies including Redis, external APIs
```

### 5. The agent configures data residency routing

```
GDPR Data Residency Configuration:

- Users with EU billing addresses are assigned region=eu at signup
- API middleware reads user region from JWT claims
- Write requests for EU users are routed to Frankfurt Postgres
- Read requests use nearest replica automatically
- Data migration script for existing EU users: moves rows from US to EU
  Postgres, updates routing table, verifies integrity

Generated middleware: src/middleware/region-router.js
Generated migration: scripts/migrate-eu-users.ts
```

## Real-World Example

Priya is the CTO of a 15-person SaaS startup that just signed an enterprise deal with a German logistics company. The contract requires EU data residency and 99.9% uptime, but everything runs on a single Hetzner server in Virginia.

1. Priya asks the agent to plan a multi-region deployment within their $2,000/month budget
2. The agent designs an active-active US/EU topology with an Asia read replica, generates Terraform configs, and writes deployment scripts
3. The agent creates a data residency middleware that routes EU user data to Frankfurt
4. Priya's team deploys the EU region first, migrates the German client's data, and passes their compliance audit
5. Global p95 latency drops from 280ms to 45ms for EU users, and the architecture survives a simulated region failure during their next game day exercise
