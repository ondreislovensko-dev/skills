# Set Up Canary Deployments with Automated Rollback Using AI

## The Problem

A 20-person SaaS startup deploys straight to production with a basic blue-green setup. Every other week, a deploy causes a spike in 5xx errors that takes 15-30 minutes to notice and another 10 minutes to roll back manually. During the last incident, a bad deploy ran for 25 minutes before anyone noticed the error rate had tripled — affecting 40% of active users. The team wants gradual rollouts with automatic rollback, but nobody has the time to research and configure the traffic splitting, health checks, and rollback triggers from scratch.

## The Solution

Use the **cicd-pipeline** skill to build the deployment pipeline, the **coding-agent** to write the canary infrastructure configuration, and **analytics-tracking** to set up the health metrics that trigger automatic rollback decisions.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install cicd-pipeline coding-agent analytics-tracking
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define your canary strategy

Tell the agent your deployment requirements:

```
Set up canary deployments for our Node.js API running on Kubernetes. I want traffic to shift gradually: 5% for 5 minutes, 25% for 10 minutes, then 100%. Auto-rollback if error rate exceeds 1% or p99 latency goes above 500ms during any canary phase. We use Prometheus for metrics.
```

### 2. The agent generates the canary configuration

The agent creates the deployment manifests and traffic splitting rules:

```
Generated canary deployment configuration:

Files created:
- k8s/canary-deployment.yaml          — Canary pod spec with resource limits
- k8s/canary-service.yaml             — Service mesh traffic splitting rules
- k8s/canary-analysis-template.yaml   — Metric queries for health checks
- .github/workflows/canary-deploy.yml — CI pipeline with staged rollout

Traffic schedule:
  Stage 1: 5% traffic  → 5 min hold → check metrics
  Stage 2: 25% traffic → 10 min hold → check metrics
  Stage 3: 100% traffic → promoted to stable
```

### 3. Configure health metric queries

The agent sets up Prometheus queries that evaluate canary health at each stage:

```
Health check metrics configured:

- Error rate: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[2m]) / rate(http_requests_total[2m])
  Threshold: < 0.01 (1%)
- Latency p99: histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[2m]))
  Threshold: < 0.5s
- Success rate: 1 - error_rate
  Threshold: > 0.99

Evaluation: every 60 seconds during canary phases
Rollback: automatic if any threshold breached for 2 consecutive checks
```

### 4. Test with a dry run

```
Run a dry-run canary deployment using our current stable version to validate the pipeline works end-to-end without risk.
```

The agent deploys the current version as a canary to verify traffic splitting, metric collection, and rollback triggers all function correctly before using it for real changes.

### 5. Add deployment notifications

The agent configures Slack notifications for each canary stage:

```
Notifications configured:
- Canary started: "Deploying v2.4.1 — canary at 5%"
- Stage promoted: "Canary v2.4.1 promoted to 25% — metrics healthy"
- Rollback triggered: "⚠️ Canary v2.4.1 rolled back — p99 latency 720ms exceeds 500ms threshold"
- Deployment complete: "✅ v2.4.1 fully promoted to production"
```

## Real-World Example

Tomás is the DevOps engineer at a 20-person fintech startup. Their last bad deploy caused payment processing errors for 25 minutes before anyone noticed.

1. He asks the agent to set up canary deployments for their Kubernetes-hosted API with automatic rollback
2. The agent generates the full configuration: deployment manifests, traffic splitting, metric queries, and CI pipeline
3. On the first real canary deploy, the new version shows elevated p99 latency at the 5% stage — the system automatically rolls back in under 90 seconds, affecting only 5% of users instead of everyone
4. Tomás reviews the rollback report, the developer fixes the performance regression, and the next deploy sails through all three stages cleanly
5. Over the next month, two bad deploys are caught at the 5% stage, reducing user-facing incidents from biweekly to zero

### 6. Review rollback history

```
Show me all canary rollbacks from the last 30 days with the metric that triggered each one and how long the canary ran before rollback.
```

The agent queries deployment logs and produces a summary so the team can identify patterns in failed deployments and address root causes.

### Tips for Better Results

- Start with conservative traffic percentages — 1-5% is enough to catch most issues
- Ensure your canary pods have the same resource limits as production to get realistic latency data
- Use multiple metric dimensions: error rate, latency, and business metrics like conversion rate
- Set hold times long enough to capture slow-burning issues, not just instant crashes
- Test your rollback mechanism separately — a rollback that doesn't work is worse than no canary at all
- Include database migration compatibility in your canary checks for stateful services
- Log which requests went to canary vs stable for post-incident debugging
