# Build an Automated Customer Support Ticket Classifier with AI

## The Problem

Your support team receives 200+ tickets per day. Each one needs to be read, categorized (billing, bug, feature request, how-to), assigned a priority, and routed to the right team. A support lead spends the first hour of every morning triaging the overnight queue. Misrouted tickets bounce between teams, high-priority issues get buried, and customers wait longer because humans are doing a job that pattern matching handles better.

## The Solution

Use **data-analysis** to analyze historical ticket patterns and build classification rules, **coding-agent** to implement the classification pipeline, and **batch-processor** to handle bulk ticket processing.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install data-analysis
npx terminal-skills install coding-agent
npx terminal-skills install batch-processor
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Analyze your existing ticket data

Export your historical tickets and let the agent learn the patterns:

```
Analyze the last 3 months of support tickets from tickets-export.csv. Columns are: id, subject, body, category, priority, assigned_team. Find the patterns that predict category and priority.
```

### 2. The agent identifies classification signals

```
Ticket Classification Analysis — 18,432 tickets analyzed:

Category Distribution:
- Billing (31%): Strong signals: "invoice", "charge", "subscription", "refund", "payment"
- Bug Report (28%): Strong signals: "error", "broken", "crash", "doesn't work", "500"
- How-To (24%): Strong signals: "how do I", "where is", "can I", "tutorial", "setup"
- Feature Request (12%): Strong signals: "would be nice", "please add", "suggestion", "wish"
- Account Access (5%): Strong signals: "locked out", "password", "can't login", "2FA"

Priority Signals:
- Urgent: "production down", "data loss", "security", "all users affected"
- High: "blocking", "can't use", "paying customer", "deadline"
- Normal: Most tickets default here
- Low: "suggestion", "someday", "minor", "cosmetic"

Classification accuracy on historical data: 91.3%
```

### 3. Build the classification pipeline

```
Create a ticket classification script that takes a new ticket (subject + body) and returns: category, priority, suggested team, and confidence score. Use the patterns from the analysis.
```

### 4. The agent implements the classifier

```python
# ticket_classifier.py — Generated classification pipeline

def classify_ticket(subject: str, body: str) -> dict:
    text = f"{subject} {body}".lower()

    # Category classification with confidence scoring
    categories = {
        "billing": ["invoice", "charge", "subscription", "refund", "payment", "plan", "upgrade"],
        "bug": ["error", "broken", "crash", "doesn't work", "500", "fail", "exception"],
        "how-to": ["how do i", "where is", "can i", "setup", "configure", "tutorial"],
        "feature-request": ["would be nice", "please add", "suggestion", "wish", "feature"],
        "account-access": ["locked out", "password", "can't login", "2fa", "reset"]
    }
    # ... scoring logic, team routing, priority detection
```

### 5. Process the ticket backlog

```
Run the classifier on all 47 unprocessed tickets in today's queue and show me the results sorted by priority.
```

The agent processes all tickets, shows the classification results with confidence scores, and flags any tickets where confidence is below 80% for manual review.

## Real-World Example

Lena manages support at a 20-person SaaS startup. The team handles 150 tickets daily with three support agents, but tickets often sit in the general queue for hours before someone reads and routes them. Using the ticket classifier:

1. Lena exports 6 months of categorized tickets and feeds them to the agent for analysis
2. The agent finds that 89% of billing tickets contain one of 15 keywords and can be auto-routed to the billing specialist
3. The agent builds a classification script that runs on each new ticket via webhook
4. Urgent bug reports now get flagged and routed to engineering within minutes instead of hours
5. The support team's average first-response time drops from 4.2 hours to 45 minutes, and misrouted tickets fall by 70%

## Tips for Ticket Classification

- **Start with high-confidence routing only** — auto-route tickets above 90% confidence; queue the rest for manual triage
- **Track false positives weekly** — a classifier that routes billing issues to engineering erodes trust fast
- **Retrain monthly** — new features create new ticket patterns that the original model won't recognize
- **Preserve the human escalation path** — customers should always be able to reach a human quickly
- **Measure time-to-first-response** — that's the metric that matters, not classification accuracy in isolation

### Classifier Metrics to Track

Set up a dashboard monitoring these metrics weekly:

- **Accuracy** — percentage of tickets correctly classified (target: >90%)
- **Confidence distribution** — how many tickets fall below the auto-routing threshold
- **Category drift** — are new ticket types emerging that don't fit existing categories?
- **Routing time saved** — compare average triage time before and after automation
- **Customer satisfaction** — ensure auto-routing doesn't negatively impact CSAT scores
