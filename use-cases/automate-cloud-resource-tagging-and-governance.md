# Automate Cloud Resource Tagging and Governance with AI

## The Problem

A 40-person engineering organization runs 200+ cloud resources across multiple environments. Only 60% of resources have proper tags, making it impossible to accurately allocate costs to teams, identify which environment a resource belongs to, or determine if something is still in use. Last month, the finance team asked engineering to break down cloud costs by product — nobody could answer because half the resources have no team or project tags. Meanwhile, 15% of the bill goes to orphaned resources from projects that ended months ago, but nobody can tell which ones are safe to delete.

## The Solution

Use the **coding-agent** to build tagging automation scripts that audit, fix, and enforce resource tags, **report-generator** to create governance dashboards, and **hetzner-cloud** for cloud infrastructure management patterns that apply across providers.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install coding-agent report-generator hetzner-cloud
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit current tagging state

Tell the agent to scan your infrastructure:

```
Audit all our cloud resources for tagging compliance. Required tags are: team, environment, project, and cost-center. Show me which resources are missing tags, which have inconsistent values, and what percentage are fully compliant.
```

### 2. The agent scans and reports

```
Tagging Audit Complete — 214 resources scanned:

Compliance: 58% fully tagged (124/214)
Missing tags:
- 43 resources missing 'team' tag
- 37 resources missing 'cost-center' tag
- 28 resources missing 'project' tag
- 12 resources missing 'environment' tag

Inconsistent values found:
- 'environment' tag: "prod", "production", "PROD", "prd" (should be: prod/staging/dev)
- 'team' tag: "backend", "Backend", "back-end", "BE" (8 variations for 3 teams)

Top untagged resource types:
- S3 buckets: 15 untagged
- Lambda functions: 12 untagged
- RDS snapshots: 9 untagged
```

### 3. Auto-fix tagging issues

```
Fix the inconsistent tag values — normalize environment to prod/staging/dev and team names to their canonical forms. For resources missing tags, infer what you can from resource names, VPC placement, and creation metadata. Show me what you'd change before applying.
```

The agent proposes a fix plan:

```
Proposed tag fixes (dry run):

Auto-inferred (high confidence):
- 31 resources: environment inferred from VPC/subnet placement
- 18 resources: team inferred from IAM creator role
- 12 resources: project inferred from resource name prefix

Normalization:
- 23 resources: environment value standardized (e.g., "production" → "prod")
- 14 resources: team value standardized (e.g., "Backend" → "backend")

Cannot infer (need manual review): 27 resources
Review file generated: untagged-resources-review.csv
```

### 4. Set up enforcement policies

The agent creates infrastructure-as-code policies that prevent untagged resources:

```
Governance policies created:

1. Pre-deploy check: Terraform plan validator rejects resources missing required tags
2. Nightly audit: Script scans for compliance drift and posts report to Slack
3. Orphan detection: Flags resources with no traffic/access for 30+ days
4. Cost report: Weekly breakdown by team and project using tag data
```

### 5. Identify orphaned resources for cleanup

```
Find all resources that appear to be orphaned — no traffic, no connections, created more than 90 days ago, and associated with completed or unknown projects.
```

```
Orphaned Resource Report:

High confidence (safe to delete):
- 4 EBS volumes (unattached, 90+ days, 2.1 TB total — $210/month)
- 3 Elastic IPs (unassociated — $10.95/month)
- 7 old snapshots (from deleted instances — $45/month)

Review recommended:
- 2 RDS instances (no connections in 60 days — $340/month)
- 5 Lambda functions (0 invocations in 90 days)

Potential monthly savings: $605.95
```

## Real-World Example

Dani is the platform engineer at a 40-person e-commerce company. Finance is asking for cost allocation by team, but 42% of cloud resources have no team tag.

1. She asks the agent to audit all 214 cloud resources for tagging compliance
2. The audit reveals 58% compliance and 8 different spellings of team names across resources
3. The agent auto-infers tags for 61 resources using VPC placement and IAM creator data, and normalizes inconsistent values
4. It sets up Terraform validation to block untagged resource creation and a nightly compliance scan
5. The orphan detection finds $605 per month in wasted resources. After cleanup and tagging enforcement, Dani delivers the cost allocation report finance wanted — broken down by team and project for the first time
