# Optimize Kubernetes Cloud Costs with AI

## The Problem

Engineering teams running Kubernetes in production routinely overprovision resources. Developers request 2 CPU and 4Gi memory for pods that actually use 0.3 CPU and 512Mi at peak. Namespaces accumulate idle deployments from abandoned feature branches. LoadBalancer services sit unused, each costing $15-20/month. The result: cloud bills 2-3x higher than necessary, and nobody has time to audit 200+ deployments across 8 namespaces.

## The Solution

Combine the `k8s-cost-optimizer` skill to analyze live resource usage against requests/limits, and `cloud-resource-analyzer` to map cluster costs to actual workload value. The agent connects to your cluster via kubectl, pulls metrics, and produces actionable right-sizing recommendations with estimated savings.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install k8s-cost-optimizer cloud-resource-analyzer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit current resource allocation vs actual usage

```
Connect to our production k8s cluster and analyze resource allocation efficiency.
Compare CPU and memory requests/limits against actual usage from metrics-server
for all namespaces. Show me the biggest gaps.
```

The agent runs kubectl top pods alongside resource requests and produces a waste report:

```
Resource Efficiency Report — production cluster (us-east-1)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Namespace: api-services (14 deployments)
  payments-api    Requested: 2 CPU / 4Gi    Actual peak: 0.4 CPU / 780Mi    Waste: 80%
  search-svc      Requested: 4 CPU / 8Gi    Actual peak: 1.1 CPU / 2.3Gi   Waste: 68%
  notifications   Requested: 1 CPU / 2Gi    Actual peak: 0.08 CPU / 120Mi   Waste: 93%

Namespace: staging (22 deployments)
  ⚠ 9 deployments with 0 requests in last 7 days (zombie workloads)

Top 5 savings opportunities:
  1. Right-size search-svc replicas:        ~$340/month saved
  2. Remove 9 zombie staging deployments:   ~$280/month saved
  3. Right-size payments-api:               ~$190/month saved
  4. Switch notifications to burstable:     ~$95/month saved
  5. Consolidate 3 nginx ingress replicas:  ~$60/month saved

Total estimated monthly savings: $965/month ($11,580/year)
```

### 2. Generate right-sizing manifests

```
Generate patched Kubernetes manifests for the top 5 recommendations.
Use the p99 usage from the last 14 days plus a 30% headroom buffer.
Output as kustomize patches I can review and apply.
```

The agent creates patch files with safe, data-backed values:

```yaml
# patches/payments-api-resources.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: payments-api
  namespace: api-services
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: payments-api
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "520m"      # p99: 400m + 30% buffer
            memory: "1014Mi" # p99: 780Mi + 30% buffer
          limits:
            cpu: "800m"
            memory: "1536Mi"
```

### 3. Identify unused cloud resources outside the cluster

```
Now check our AWS account for cloud resources attached to this cluster that
might be orphaned — unused EBS volumes, old snapshots, unattached elastic IPs,
and idle load balancers with zero healthy targets.
```

```
Orphaned Cloud Resources — AWS us-east-1
────────────────────────────────────────
EBS Volumes (available, unattached):
  vol-0a3f8c912b  100Gi gp3  Created: 2025-08-14  Tag: k8s-staging-pvc  $8.00/mo
  vol-0e7d21ca44  250Gi gp3  Created: 2025-06-02  Tag: old-postgres-data $20.00/mo
  vol-0b1199ef03   50Gi gp3  Created: 2025-11-20  Tag: none              $4.00/mo

Elastic IPs (unassociated): 3 IPs × $3.60/mo = $10.80/mo

ELBs with 0 healthy targets: 2 load balancers = $36.00/mo

Snapshots older than 90 days: 47 snapshots = ~$28.00/mo

Total orphaned resource cost: $106.80/month
```

### 4. Create a cleanup plan with safety checks

```
Create a cleanup script for the orphaned resources. Include dry-run mode,
tag verification, and a 7-day grace period where resources get tagged
for-deletion before actual removal.
```

The agent generates a bash script with safeguards and a scheduling recommendation.

## Real-World Example

Ravi, a platform engineer at a 40-person fintech startup, noticed their AWS bill climbed from $8,200 to $14,600/month over six months despite no major new services. Using the k8s-cost-optimizer skill, he discovered:

1. He asked the agent to audit the production EKS cluster across all namespaces
2. The agent found 11 zombie deployments in staging from old feature branches, consuming 8 vCPUs and 16Gi memory — roughly $420/month doing nothing
3. The search service was provisioned for Black Friday traffic year-round; right-sizing it to p99+30% saved $340/month
4. The agent then scanned AWS for orphaned resources and found 6 unattached EBS volumes and 47 stale snapshots from a database migration three months ago
5. Total identified savings: $1,071/month. Ravi applied the kustomize patches in staging first, monitored for a week, then rolled to production

Within one sprint, the monthly bill dropped to $11,200 — a 23% reduction with zero performance impact.
