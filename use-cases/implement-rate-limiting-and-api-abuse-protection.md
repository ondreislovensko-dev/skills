# Implement Rate Limiting and API Abuse Protection

## The Problem

Maya, platform engineer at a 60-person API-first company, gets woken up at 3:47 AM by PagerDuty alerts: "API response times >10 seconds." By the time she logs in, their payment processing API has crashed under a flood of 47,000 requests in 12 minutes from a single IP address. The attacker is hammering their `/api/payments/validate` endpoint — a resource-intensive operation that queries 3 external payment processors and takes 2.1 seconds per legitimate request.

This isn't their first rodeo. Last month, a scraped API key was used to make 156,000 requests in 4 hours, generating a $2,847 bill from external API providers (Stripe, Auth0, SendGrid). The month before, a competitor's bot discovered their `/api/users/search` endpoint and scraped 340,000 user profiles in 6 hours before the team noticed unusual traffic patterns. Each search query costs $0.12 in database resources and third-party enrichment API calls.

The current "solution": manual IP blocking after damage is done. No proactive rate limiting, no abuse detection, no automated response. The team reactive-scales servers during attacks, burning through their infrastructure budget. Last quarter's "unusual traffic" incidents cost $8,200 in extra server capacity, $4,100 in external API overage fees, and 67 hours of engineering time on incident response. Their legitimate API users get caught in the crossfire when servers slow down or crash.

## The Solution

Implement intelligent API protection using **rate-limiter** for sophisticated traffic controls and **security-audit** for threat detection and response. The approach: implement graduated rate limiting based on user behavior, detect and block abusive patterns automatically, and maintain service quality for legitimate users while stopping attacks.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install rate-limiter security-audit
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Implement multi-tier rate limiting with user-based controls

```
Set up rate limiting for our Node.js API with different limits for different user tiers and endpoints. Free users get 100 requests/hour, paid users get 1000 requests/hour, enterprise users get 10,000 requests/hour. High-cost endpoints like payment validation should have stricter limits. Include IP-based limits as a backstop against abuse.
```

```
🛡️  MULTI-TIER RATE LIMITING SETUP...

Rate limiting architecture (src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts):

USER TIER-BASED LIMITS:
├── Free tier: 100 requests/hour, 10 requests/minute burst
├── Paid tier: 1,000 requests/hour, 50 requests/minute burst  
├── Enterprise: 10,000 requests/hour, 200 requests/minute burst
└── Anonymous: 20 requests/hour, 2 requests/minute burst

ENDPOINT-SPECIFIC LIMITS:
High-cost operations:
├── POST /api/payments/validate: 10 requests/hour (costs $0.89 per call)
├── POST /api/users/search: 50 requests/hour (costs $0.12 per query)
├── GET /api/reports/analytics: 20 requests/hour (heavy database queries)
└── POST /api/integrations/sync: 5 requests/hour (third-party API calls)

Standard operations:
├── GET /api/users/profile: User tier limit applies
├── GET /api/dashboard/widgets: User tier limit applies  
├── POST /api/auth/login: 10 attempts/hour per IP (brute force prevention)
└── POST /api/auth/signup: 5 signups/hour per IP (spam prevention)

IP-BASED BACKSTOP LIMITS:
├── 2,000 requests/hour per IP (prevents single IP abuse)
├── 100 requests/minute per IP (burst protection)
├── 10 requests/second per IP (DDoS mitigation)
└── Automatic temporary blocking: 5-minute penalty for limit violations

REDIS-BACKED IMPLEMENTATION:
✅ Sliding window rate limiting (more accurate than fixed windows)
✅ Distributed rate limiting across multiple API servers
✅ Persistent rate limit counters (survive server restarts)  
✅ Efficient Redis operations (INCR with TTL, minimal memory usage)
✅ Rate limit headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset

GRADUATED RESPONSES:
- Under 80% of limit: Normal response (200ms avg)
- 80-95% of limit: Add 429 warning header, continue processing
- 95-100% of limit: Slightly delayed response (+200ms, discourages automation)
- Over limit: 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header
```

### 2. Add behavioral analysis and abuse detection

```
Implement intelligent abuse detection that identifies suspicious patterns beyond simple rate limits. Detect scrapers, bot behavior, distributed attacks, and API key abuse. Include automatic escalation from warnings to temporary blocks to permanent bans based on threat severity.
```

```
🔍 BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS & ABUSE DETECTION...

Abuse detection patterns (src/security/abuse-detector.ts):

SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR INDICATORS:
├── Rapid sequential requests (>5 per second for >30 seconds)
├── Unusual request patterns (same endpoint, predictable intervals)  
├── High error rates (>20% 4xx responses suggests probing)
├── Large request payloads on rate-limited endpoints (resource exhaustion)
├── User-Agent patterns (missing, fake, or automated tool signatures)
├── Geographic anomalies (API key used from 6 countries in 1 hour)
└── Time-based patterns (24/7 usage suggests automation)

AUTOMATIC THREAT CLASSIFICATION:
🟡 Low threat (monitoring):
- Slightly elevated usage (110% of normal pattern)
- Response time: normal, add monitoring headers
- Action: Enhanced logging, no restrictions

🟠 Medium threat (throttling):  
- Clear automation detected (regular intervals, high volume)
- Response time: +500ms delay, reduce rate limits by 50%
- Action: Temporary throttling, security team notification

🔴 High threat (blocking):
- Attack patterns (DDoS, scraping, resource exhaustion)
- Response time: immediate 429 or 403 blocking
- Action: 1-24 hour IP/API key suspension, incident response

DISTRIBUTED ATTACK DETECTION:
✅ Coordinated attacks: Multiple IPs with similar patterns
✅ Botnet detection: Large number of low-volume requests from different IPs
✅ API key sharing: Single key used from multiple IPs simultaneously
✅ Geography-based anomalies: Requests from countries not matching user profile

REAL-TIME ANALYSIS ENGINE:
- Sliding window analysis: Evaluate behavior over 1min, 15min, 1hour, 24hour windows
- Machine learning scoring: Behavioral anomaly detection (trains on historical data)
- Threat intelligence: Integration with known bad IP databases
- False positive prevention: Whitelisting for known good behaviors

ESCALATION WORKFLOW:
1. First violation: Warning logged, rate limits remain normal
2. Second violation (within 24h): Rate limits reduced 50%, 15-minute cooldown
3. Third violation: 1-hour temporary block, security team alerted
4. Repeated violations: 24-hour block, manual review required for reinstatement
```

### 3. Implement automatic blocking and response mechanisms

```
Set up automated response systems that can block attacks in real-time without manual intervention. Include IP blocking, API key suspension, geographic blocking, and emergency lockdown modes. Ensure legitimate users aren't affected while stopping abusive traffic.
```

```
⚡ AUTOMATED BLOCKING & RESPONSE SYSTEMS...

Automatic blocking mechanisms (src/security/auto-blocker.ts):

IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TRIGGERS:
├── >1,000 requests/minute from single IP → Instant 5-minute block
├── >100 failed authentication attempts/hour → IP-based auth block  
├── Payment validation >50/hour per key → API key temporary suspension
├── Search scraping detected (>500 different queries/hour) → Search blocking
└── DDoS pattern (>10,000 requests from >100 IPs) → Emergency mode

BLOCKING STRATEGIES:
IP-based blocking:
- Redis blacklist with automatic TTL expiry
- Graduated penalties: 5min → 1hr → 24hr → permanent review
- Geographic blocking: Temporarily block countries during attacks
- Network range blocking: CIDR-based blocking for sophisticated attackers

API key suspension:
- Temporary key suspension (1hr to 24hr based on severity)
- Rate limit reduction (enterprise → free tier limits)
- Feature restrictions (disable high-cost endpoints)
- Automatic reinstatement with monitoring

Emergency protection modes:
- Lockdown mode: Only authenticated, known-good users allowed
- Read-only mode: Disable write operations during attacks  
- Reduced functionality: Disable resource-intensive endpoints
- Circuit breaker: Automatic activation based on system load

LEGITIMATE USER PROTECTION:
✅ Whitelist known good IPs (company VPNs, trusted partners)
✅ User behavior learning (gradually increase limits for consistent users)
✅ False positive detection (automatic unblocking of legitimate traffic)
✅ Business hour exceptions (relaxed limits during peak usage)
✅ Customer support override (manual whitelist during false positives)

RESPONSE COORDINATION:
- Real-time blocking: Response within 100ms of pattern detection
- Distributed coordination: Share threat intelligence across API servers
- External integration: Update CloudFlare WAF rules automatically  
- Incident logging: Detailed attack analysis for post-incident review

ATTACK MITIGATION RESULTS:
✅ Average attack response time: 23 seconds (from detection to blocking)
✅ False positive rate: 0.3% (manual review and improvement)  
✅ Attack success prevention: 98.7% of attacks stopped before damage
✅ Legitimate user impact: <0.1% of good traffic affected
```

### 4. Add monitoring, alerting, and forensic analysis

```
Create comprehensive monitoring for API abuse attempts, successful blocks, system performance during attacks, and detailed forensics for security analysis. Include real-time dashboards, automated incident response, and detailed attack attribution.
```

```

```

## Real-World Example

A fintech startup offering credit score APIs was hemorrhaging money from abuse. Their `/api/credit/check` endpoint cost $1.47 per call (Experian + TransUnion data) and was being hammered by scrapers who had discovered the endpoint through documentation. Over Memorial Day weekend, someone automated 23,000 credit checks at a cost of $33,810 before the team noticed on Tuesday morning.

The pattern repeated monthly: API key theft from client-side JavaScript, scraped endpoints from documentation, automated abuse costing thousands. Their highest single incident: a competitor scraped 67,000 user profiles using a leaked API key, generating $47,000 in third-party API charges and violating compliance requirements.

The breaking point came when their largest enterprise customer threatened to leave after experiencing 8-second response times during a scraping attack that overwhelmed their servers.

**Implementation using rate-limiter and security-audit skills:**

**Week 1: Emergency rate limiting**
- Implemented aggressive rate limits on expensive endpoints
- Added IP-based blocking for obvious abuse patterns
- Reduced credit check endpoint to 10/hour for free users

**Week 2: Behavioral analysis**
- Deployed machine learning-based abuse detection
- Added API key usage pattern analysis
- Implemented graduated response system (warning → throttling → blocking)

**Week 3: Automated response systems**  
- Real-time blocking of attack patterns (response time <30 seconds)
- Emergency lockdown modes for severe attacks
- Integration with CloudFlare for edge-level blocking

**Results after 60 days:**
- **Abuse incidents**: 12-15/month → 2-3/month (85% reduction)
- **External API costs from abuse**: $33,810/month → $1,200/month (96% reduction)
- **False positive rate**: 0.2% (legitimate users rarely affected)
- **Attack response time**: Manual (2-8 hours) → Automated (15-45 seconds)
- **System availability during attacks**: 67% → 99.4%
- **Customer satisfaction**: Credit check response times consistent <2 seconds

**Unexpected benefits:**
- **Compliance improvement**: Automated audit trails for all API access
- **Customer trust**: Enterprise customers renewed after seeing security improvements
- **Competitive advantage**: Competitors' scraping attempts now fail, protecting proprietary data
- **Cost predictability**: API usage costs became predictable with abuse eliminated

The security system now prevents an estimated $28,000/month in abuse-related costs while maintaining sub-200ms response times for legitimate users. Most importantly, the engineering team went from spending 2-3 days/week on abuse incidents to receiving automated daily reports showing the system successfully blocked attacks without intervention.
