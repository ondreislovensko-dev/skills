# Run Profitable Paid Ad Campaigns

## The Problem

You are spending $5,000/month on Google Ads and Meta Ads but have no idea which campaigns are actually profitable. Your Google Analytics shows conversions, but the numbers never match what your CRM reports. You have run "A/B tests" by changing ad copy every few days and eyeballing the results, but without statistical rigor you cannot tell signal from noise. Last quarter you spent $15,000 and your best guess at return is "somewhere between 2x and 5x."

Without proper tracking, you cannot optimize. Without proper testing, you cannot learn. Without both, paid ads are an expensive guessing game.

## The Solution

Use **paid-ads** to structure campaigns with proper targeting, bidding, and budget allocation, **ab-test-setup** to design statistically valid experiments on ad creative and landing pages, and **analytics-tracking** to implement end-to-end conversion tracking from ad click through to revenue.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Fix your tracking foundation

Nothing else matters if you cannot accurately measure what happens after someone clicks an ad.

> Set up conversion tracking for our SaaS. We need to track: ad click, landing page visit, signup, trial start, and paid conversion. We use Google Ads, Meta Ads, and Segment.

The agent builds a tracking plan with UTM parameter conventions, Google Ads conversion actions mapped to each funnel stage, Meta Pixel custom events, and a Segment tracking plan that unifies both platforms into a single source of truth. It includes a data validation checklist to verify events fire correctly before spending budget.

### 2. Structure campaigns for profitability

Most wasted ad spend comes from poor campaign structure -- broad targeting, no negative keywords, and budgets spread too thin across too many ad groups.

> Restructure our Google Ads for a project management SaaS. Monthly budget: $5,000. Current campaigns are one broad campaign with 47 keywords. Target CPA: $45.

The agent restructures into 4 tightly themed campaigns: branded (lowest CPA, highest intent), competitor (users searching for alternatives), problem-aware ("how to manage remote teams"), and solution-aware ("best project management tool"). Each campaign has 8-12 keywords, negative keyword lists to prevent overlap, and budget allocation weighted toward proven converters.

### 3. Design rigorous A/B tests

Stop guessing which ad creative works. Design experiments that produce statistically significant results.

> Set up an A/B test for our top Google Ads campaign. We want to test benefit-focused headlines ("Save 5 hours/week") vs. social-proof headlines ("Used by 2,400 teams"). Current CTR is 3.2%, we want to detect a 20% improvement.

The agent calculates sample size requirements (approximately 4,700 impressions per variant at 95% confidence), sets test duration based on current traffic volume, defines primary and secondary metrics, and specifies stopping rules to prevent premature conclusions.

### 4. Build a weekly optimization dashboard

Ongoing optimization requires weekly attention to the right metrics, not daily panic over normal fluctuations.

> Create a weekly paid ads review checklist and dashboard. Include Google Ads and Meta Ads. Focus on CPA, ROAS, and quality score trends.

The agent produces a structured weekly review template: Monday morning metrics pull, campaign-level CPA and ROAS comparison, keyword-level performance with action thresholds (pause keywords above $90 CPA, increase bids on keywords below $30 CPA), and a monthly budget reallocation framework based on rolling 30-day performance.

## Real-World Example

Sara managed paid ads for a B2B scheduling tool spending $5,000/month across Google and Meta. She suspected Meta was underperforming but could not prove it -- her tracking was a mess of misconfigured UTM parameters and a Meta Pixel that fired on every page load instead of only on conversions.

She ran the three-skill workflow over two days. The tracking overhaul revealed that Meta was actually generating 40% of signups but only 8% of paid conversions -- it drove top-of-funnel awareness but not revenue. Google Ads restructuring consolidated 47 scattered keywords into 4 focused campaigns, immediately cutting wasted spend on irrelevant searches. The A/B test on headlines showed that social-proof variants ("Join 2,400 teams") beat benefit-focused copy by 31% on CTR with 97% statistical confidence.

After 60 days of structured optimization, CPA dropped from $67 to $38, ROAS improved from 2.1x to 4.3x, and Sara reallocated 60% of the Meta budget to Google branded and competitor campaigns where the unit economics actually worked. The same $5,000/month now generated 132 trials per month instead of 74.
