# Automate a Blender Film Production Pipeline from Compositing to Final Export

## The Problem

A small animation studio producing a 12-minute short film has 47 scenes, each requiring compositing passes (color grading, green screen keying, light mixing), assembly in the Video Sequence Editor, and rendering at 4K. Doing this manually means an artist spends 3 hours per scene on repetitive node setup and render configuration. With 47 scenes and constant revision requests from the director, the team is stuck in an endless loop of re-rendering.

## The Solution

Using **blender-compositing** to automate node tree construction, **blender-vse-pipeline** to assemble edited sequences, **blender-render-automation** to distribute renders across machines, and **blender-scripting** to glue it all together with Python, the studio reduces per-scene turnaround from 3 hours to 15 minutes.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Script compositing node trees for all scenes

Define reusable compositing templates in Python that apply consistent color grading, glare, and keying nodes across every scene file.

> Set up a Blender Python script that opens each .blend scene file in /scenes/, adds a compositing node tree with color balance, glare, and alpha-over nodes for green screen keying, and saves the result. Use the blender-compositing skill.

### 2. Configure distributed rendering across the render farm

Set up render automation so each scene is split into frame ranges and dispatched to 4 machines, with automatic retry on failure.

> Use blender-render-automation to configure our 4-node render farm. Split scene_017.blend (frames 1-240) into 4 chunks of 60 frames each, assign one chunk per machine, render at 4K with Cycles at 256 samples, and merge the output EXR sequences.

The render farm configuration defines node capabilities, chunk assignment, and failure handling:

```yaml
# render_farm.yaml
render_settings:
  engine: cycles
  resolution: [3840, 2160]
  samples: 256
  output_format: OPEN_EXR_MULTILAYER
  color_depth: 32

nodes:
  - host: render-01.local
    gpus: 2x RTX 4090
    max_concurrent: 2
  - host: render-02.local
    gpus: 2x RTX 4090
    max_concurrent: 2
  - host: render-03.local
    gpus: 1x RTX 4080
    max_concurrent: 1
  - host: render-04.local
    gpus: 1x RTX 4080
    max_concurrent: 1

chunking:
  strategy: frame_range
  chunk_size: 60
  priority: scene_complexity

retry:
  max_attempts: 3
  on_failure: reassign_to_next_available
  notify: pipeline@studio.local
```

The retry policy ensures that if a render node crashes mid-chunk (a common occurrence during overnight farm runs), the failed frames are automatically reassigned to the next available machine rather than silently producing gaps in the output sequence.

### 3. Assemble the final edit in the Video Sequence Editor

Combine all rendered scene outputs into the final timeline with transitions, audio sync, and title cards.

> Use blender-vse-pipeline to import all 47 rendered scene folders from /renders/ into the VSE timeline in the order specified by edit_list.csv. Add 12-frame cross-dissolve transitions between scenes, sync the master audio track from /audio/final_mix.wav, and add the title card from /assets/title.png for the first 3 seconds.

### 4. Build a one-command pipeline script

Tie every step into a single Python script that watches for updated scene files and re-runs only the changed portions.

> Use blender-scripting to create a master pipeline script that: detects which .blend files changed since the last run, re-applies compositing nodes only to changed files, triggers rendering for those scenes, and re-assembles the VSE timeline with the updated renders. Log each step to pipeline.log.

## Real-World Example

A three-person animation team used this pipeline for a 12-minute festival short. After the director requested color grading changes to 23 scenes on a Friday afternoon, the pipeline re-applied compositing nodes, re-rendered only the affected scenes across 4 machines overnight, and reassembled the final edit by Saturday morning. What would have been a week of manual rework was done in 9 hours with zero artist intervention.

## Tips

- Render to OpenEXR multilayer format instead of PNG. It preserves all compositing passes so color grading changes do not require a full re-render.
- Set the chunking strategy to scene complexity rather than equal frame ranges. Heavy particle scenes need more time per frame than static dialogue shots.
