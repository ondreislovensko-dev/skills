# Automate Market Research and Extract 10,000+ Data Points Daily

## The Problem

Priya, head of product at a 53-person e-commerce startup, needs competitive pricing data from 12 major retailers to stay competitive. Currently, her team manually checks 2,847 competing products across these sites every Monday. Each product requires 3-4 clicks to find price, availability, reviews, and specifications. The process consumes 18 hours of analyst time weekly — nearly half an FTE purely for data collection.

The manual approach is failing catastrophically. By the time they complete Monday's research, competitors have already adjusted pricing twice. The team spotted a 23% competitor price drop on Friday, but their product manager didn't learn until the following Wednesday. Result: $67,000 in lost sales during those five days of price misalignment. They're fighting with last week's information in a daily-change market.

Data quality compounds the problem. Human error rate: 8.3% from copy-paste mistakes, inconsistent categorization, and missed product variants. Critical data points get overlooked: promotional pricing, stock levels, customer sentiment from reviews. The analysts are burning out — two quit this quarter citing "soul-crushing repetitive work." Hiring replacement analysts at $65,000 annually isn't solving the underlying inefficiency.

## The Solution

Combine **web-scraper** for data extraction, **data-analysis** for pattern recognition, and **batch-processor** for scalable automation. The approach: build intelligent scrapers that adapt to site changes, process data at scale with quality validation, and deliver real-time competitive intelligence.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install web-scraper data-analysis batch-processor
```

## Real-World Example

The pricing manager at a mid-size consumer electronics company was losing market share to competitors who seemed to always know their prices first. With 1,200+ products across 8 major categories, manual competitor monitoring was impossible. They hired 2 dedicated analysts just for pricing research, costing $130,000 annually, but still couldn't keep up with market velocity.

Monday: web-scraper analyzed 15 competitor sites and built adaptive scrapers. Discovered that competitors were adjusting prices 3-4x weekly based on market data — explaining how they always seemed one step ahead.

Tuesday: Implemented batch processing to collect 1,200 products × 15 sites = 18,000 data points twice daily. Found that their "premium pricing" strategy was actually inconsistent — premium on some products, overpriced on others, underpriced on high-demand items.

Wednesday: data-analysis revealed market patterns invisible to manual research. Competitors systematically underprice during restocking periods, then increase prices once inventory normalizes. Seasonal trends showed optimal pricing windows for maximum margin.

Results after 6 weeks: Recovered 4.7% market share through strategic repricing. Revenue increased $340,000 quarterly from optimized pricing decisions. The two pricing analysts were reassigned to strategic work (market expansion, product planning). ROI: The entire automation system paid for itself in 23 days of improved pricing decisions.
