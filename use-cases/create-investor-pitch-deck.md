# Create an Investor Pitch Deck from Product Data

## The Problem

You're raising a seed round. Investors expect a polished 12-15 slide deck that tells a compelling story backed by data. You have the data — MRR growth, user metrics, market research — scattered across Stripe dashboards, analytics tools, and spreadsheets. What you don't have is 40 hours to learn pitch deck design, or $5,000-15,000 for a deck agency.

Most founder-made decks fail for the same reasons: too much text, no visual hierarchy, metrics presented without context, and a story that buries the lead. You know your business — you just need help translating raw data into a narrative that makes investors lean forward.

## The Solution

Use **data-visualizer** to turn raw metrics into clean charts, **content-writer** to craft the narrative and key messaging, and **ai-slides** to assemble everything into a professional deck.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install data-visualizer content-writer ai-slides
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Organize your raw data

```
Here's our key data: MRR from Stripe export (mrr.csv), user metrics from our analytics (users.csv), and market research notes (market-research.md). Analyze and identify the strongest data points for a seed-stage pitch.
```

```
STRONGEST DATA POINTS:

Growth metrics:
  MRR: $18K → $47K in 8 months (161% growth)
  MoM growth rate: 12.8% average (top quartile for seed stage)
  Net revenue retention: 118%

User metrics:
  1,240 active users, 89% week-1 retention
  DAU/MAU ratio: 0.42 (strong engagement — Slack-level)
  Organic signups: 67% (low CAC dependency)

Market opportunity:
  TAM: $8.2B (developer tools for mid-market)
  Growing 23% YoY per industry reports
  3 incumbents, all enterprise-focused (mid-market gap)
```

### 2. Create the narrative arc

```
Write the pitch narrative. Follow the classic structure: problem, insight, solution, traction, market, business model, team, ask. Make it compelling for seed investors.
```

```
NARRATIVE ARC:

Slide 1 — Title: [Company] — Developer tools that mid-market teams actually use
Slide 2 — Problem: Mid-market eng teams (50-500 people) are stuck between
  tools built for 5-person startups and enterprise platforms requiring
  6-month implementations. They waste 8 hours/week/engineer on tooling gaps.
Slide 3 — Insight: Mid-market teams don't need simpler enterprise tools.
  They need tools designed for their workflow from day one.
Slide 4 — Solution: [One-line + screenshot + 3 key capabilities]
Slide 5 — Traction: $47K MRR, 161% growth, 1,240 users, 118% NRR
Slide 6 — How it works: [Product demo flow, 3 steps]
Slide 7 — Market: $8.2B TAM, 23% growth, mid-market underserved
Slide 8 — Business model: Self-serve + sales-assisted, $200-2,000/mo
Slide 9 — Competition: Positioning matrix showing the mid-market gap
Slide 10 — Go-to-market: Product-led growth + community + partnerships
Slide 11 — Team: Founders' relevant experience and unfair advantages
Slide 12 — Financials: 18-month projection, path to $1M ARR
Slide 13 — Ask: $2.5M seed, 18 months runway, 3 key milestones
```

### 3. Generate data visualizations

```
Create charts for the traction slide: MRR growth (bar chart), retention curve, and DAU/MAU trend. Use clean, minimal styling with our brand colors.
```

```
Generated 4 charts:
  mrr-growth.svg — Bar chart, 8 months, clear upward trend, $47K highlighted
  retention-curve.svg — Cohort retention, 89% week-1 flattening at 61% month-3
  engagement-trend.svg — DAU/MAU line chart, steady at 0.42 with benchmarks
  market-size.svg — TAM/SAM/SOM concentric circles with growth rate

All charts: minimal grid, brand colors (#2563EB, #1E293B), no chartjunk
Exported as SVG (scalable) and PNG (for compatibility)
```

### 4. Assemble the deck

```
Build the full pitch deck using our narrative and charts. 13 slides, clean design, consistent typography.
```

```
Generated: pitch-deck-seed-2026.pptx (13 slides)

Design specs:
  Typography: Inter for headings, system sans for body
  Layout: max 30 words per slide, heavy use of whitespace
  Data slides: one key metric per slide with supporting chart
  Consistent color: brand blue for emphasis, dark gray for text

Speaker notes included for each slide with talking points
Also exported: pitch-deck-seed-2026.pdf (for email sharing)
```

### 5. Create variant versions

```
Make a 5-slide teaser version for cold emails and a detailed appendix with unit economics, cohort data, and competitive analysis.
```

```
Teaser (5 slides): problem, solution, traction, market, ask
  pitch-teaser-2026.pdf — optimized for email attachment (<3MB)

Appendix (8 slides): unit economics, cohort analysis, competitive matrix,
  customer quotes, product roadmap, detailed financials, team bios, cap table
  pitch-appendix-2026.pptx — for follow-up meetings

Total package: teaser for intros, full deck for partner meetings, appendix for diligence
```

## Real-World Example

Marta, co-founder of a developer tools startup, had 3 weeks before her first investor meetings. Her metrics were strong — $47K MRR with 12.8% month-over-month growth — but her existing deck was 22 slides of bullet points on white backgrounds. Two angel investors had already passed after seeing it.

She exported Stripe data, pulled analytics CSVs, and gathered her market research notes. The data-visualizer turned her MRR spreadsheet into a clean growth chart that immediately showed the trajectory. The content-writer restructured her narrative — moving the traction slide from slide 9 to slide 5, leading with momentum. The ai-slides tool assembled everything into a cohesive 13-slide deck.

She sent the 5-slide teaser to 12 investors. Seven took meetings — up from 2 out of 10 with her old deck. In the meetings, the data visualizations did the heavy lifting: investors could see the retention curve flattening at 61%, proving stickiness without Marta needing to explain it. She closed $2.5M in 6 weeks.
