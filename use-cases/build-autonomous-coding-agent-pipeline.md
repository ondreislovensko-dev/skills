# Build an Autonomous Coding Agent Pipeline for Your Team

Tomás leads a 4-person engineering team at a fintech startup. They have 47 open GitHub issues — bug fixes, feature requests, documentation updates, test coverage gaps. The backlog grows faster than the team can ship. Junior devs spend 60% of their time on boilerplate: CRUD endpoints, form validation, test scaffolding, API documentation. Senior devs spend 30% of their time reviewing obvious issues that a linter should catch.

Tomás sets up three AI coding agents, each handling a different layer of the workflow: Aider runs autonomously on GitHub issues, Continue provides in-IDE assistance with full project context, and Cline handles complex multi-file refactoring tasks.

## Step 1: Autonomous Issue Resolution with Aider

Aider is a terminal-based AI coding agent that reads your codebase, makes changes across multiple files, and commits with proper messages. Tomás configures it to automatically process GitHub issues labeled `ai-ready`.

```bash
# Install Aider
pip install aider-chat

# Configure for the project
cd /path/to/project

# .aider.conf.yml — Project-level configuration
cat > .aider.conf.yml << 'EOF'
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
edit-format: diff                        # Use diff format for cleaner edits
auto-commits: true                       # Commit changes automatically
auto-lint: true                          # Run linter after changes
lint-cmd: "npm run lint:fix"
auto-test: true                          # Run tests after changes
test-cmd: "npm test"
map-tokens: 2048                         # Repository map token budget
read:                                    # Always include these for context
  - src/types/index.ts
  - src/lib/db/schema.ts
  - .cursor/rules/backend.mdc
EOF
```

```python
# scripts/auto_resolve_issues.py — Process GitHub issues with Aider
import subprocess
import json
from github import Github

gh = Github(os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"])
repo = gh.get_repo("company/backend")

def process_issue(issue):
    """Resolve a GitHub issue using Aider autonomously.

    Args:
        issue: GitHub issue object with 'ai-ready' label

    Flow:
        1. Create a branch from main
        2. Run Aider with the issue description as prompt
        3. If tests pass, create a PR
        4. Link PR to the issue
    """
    branch_name = f"ai/{issue.number}-{slugify(issue.title)}"

    # Create branch
    subprocess.run(["git", "checkout", "-b", branch_name, "origin/main"], check=True)

    # Build the prompt from issue context
    prompt = f"""Fix GitHub issue #{issue.number}: {issue.title}

Description:
{issue.body}

Requirements:
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Add or update tests for any changed logic
- Update relevant documentation
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the issue"""

    # Run Aider with the prompt
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["aider", "--yes-always", "--message", prompt],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        timeout=300,                       # 5 minute timeout
    )

    if result.returncode == 0:
        # Push and create PR
        subprocess.run(["git", "push", "origin", branch_name], check=True)
        pr = repo.create_pull(
            title=f"fix: resolve #{issue.number} — {issue.title}",
            body=f"Closes #{issue.number}\n\nAutonomously resolved by Aider.\n\n{result.stdout[-500:]}",
            head=branch_name,
            base="main",
        )
        issue.create_comment(f"🤖 Created PR #{pr.number} to resolve this issue.")
        return pr
    else:
        issue.create_comment(
            f"🤖 Attempted automatic resolution but encountered issues:\n```\n{result.stderr[-300:]}\n```\nNeeds human attention."
        )
        return None

# Process all ai-ready issues
for issue in repo.get_issues(labels=["ai-ready"], state="open"):
    print(f"Processing #{issue.number}: {issue.title}")
    process_issue(issue)
```

## Step 2: In-IDE AI Assistance with Continue

While Aider handles standalone issues, the team needs AI assistance during active development. Continue is an open-source IDE extension that connects to any LLM and understands the full project context through custom providers.

```json
// .continue/config.json — Team-shared Continue configuration
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Claude Sonnet (Fast)",
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      "apiKey": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
    },
    {
      "title": "Claude Opus (Complex)",
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-opus-4-20250514",
      "apiKey": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
    }
  ],
  "tabAutocompleteModel": {
    "title": "Codestral",
    "provider": "mistral",
    "model": "codestral-latest"
  },
  "contextProviders": [
    { "name": "code", "params": {} },
    { "name": "docs", "params": {} },
    { "name": "diff", "params": {} },
    { "name": "terminal", "params": {} },
    { "name": "open", "params": {} },
    { "name": "codebase", "params": {} },
    {
      "name": "url",
      "params": { "url": "https://docs.company.com/api-reference" }
    }
  ],
  "slashCommands": [
    { "name": "commit", "description": "Generate a commit message" },
    { "name": "review", "description": "Review selected code for bugs" },
    { "name": "test", "description": "Generate tests for selected code" },
    { "name": "docs", "description": "Generate JSDoc documentation" }
  ],
  "customCommands": [
    {
      "name": "api-endpoint",
      "description": "Scaffold a new tRPC endpoint with validation, tests, and docs",
      "prompt": "Create a new tRPC endpoint based on this description. Follow the patterns in src/server/routers/. Include: Zod input schema, the procedure implementation, a test file, and update the router index. {{{ input }}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Developers use Continue for in-flow assistance: highlight code and ask "why is this slow?", use `/test` to generate tests for a function, use `@codebase` to find related patterns. The tab completion from Codestral handles line-by-line suggestions.

## Step 3: Complex Refactoring with Cline

For large refactoring tasks that touch 20+ files — migrating from one ORM to another, restructuring the API layer, adding TypeScript strict mode — Cline provides an agentic experience with human-in-the-loop approval.

```markdown
## Cline Workflow for Major Refactoring

Cline runs in VS Code as an autonomous agent that:
1. Plans the changes (shows you the plan first)
2. Reads relevant files across the codebase
3. Makes changes file by file (you approve each)
4. Runs tests after each change
5. Rolls back if tests fail

### Example: Migrate from Prisma to Drizzle ORM

Prompt to Cline:
"Migrate our database layer from Prisma to Drizzle ORM.
The Prisma schema is at prisma/schema.prisma.
Create equivalent Drizzle schema in src/db/schema.ts.
Update all repository files in src/server/db/repos/ to use Drizzle query syntax.
Update the database client initialization in src/server/db/index.ts.
Keep all existing tests passing — update test mocks as needed."

### Cline's approach:
1. Reads prisma/schema.prisma to understand all models
2. Creates src/db/schema.ts with Drizzle table definitions
3. Updates each repo file one at a time (you review each diff)
4. Updates db client initialization
5. Runs `npm test` after each file change
6. If tests fail, proposes fixes or rolls back
```

## Results After 60 Days

The team's velocity increased from 18 story points per sprint to 52. The backlog dropped from 47 issues to 12. Junior devs now focus on feature logic instead of boilerplate — Aider handles the CRUD endpoints, Continue generates the tests, and Cline does the heavy refactoring.

- **Aider**: Resolved 23 of 47 backlog issues autonomously (49% success rate); 18 PRs merged without human code changes
- **Continue**: Used by all 4 devs daily; average 45 AI interactions per developer per day
- **Cline**: Completed 3 major refactoring tasks that would have taken 2 weeks each manually — done in 2 days each with AI assistance
- **Test coverage**: 62% → 84% (AI-generated tests for existing code)
- **PR cycle time**: 4.1 days → 1.6 days
