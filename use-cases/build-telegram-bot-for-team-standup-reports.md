# Build a Telegram Bot That Collects Daily Standup Reports

## The Problem

A remote development team of 12 people across 4 time zones tries to do daily standups via a Telegram group chat. The result is chaotic: some people post at 8 AM their time, others at noon, and two or three consistently forget. The manager scrolls through a mix of standup updates, unrelated discussions, and memes trying to piece together who did what. There is no structured format, so updates range from one-word answers to multi-paragraph essays. Compiling a weekly summary for stakeholders takes 45 minutes of manual copy-pasting every Friday.

## The Solution

Using **telegram-bot-builder** to create an interactive standup bot with scheduled prompts and conversation flows, **template-engine** to format consistent daily and weekly reports, and **batch-processor** to handle timezone-aware scheduling for all 12 team members, the manager gets structured standup data without chasing anyone.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Build the standup conversation flow

Create a bot that privately messages each team member with three standup questions and collects structured responses.

> Use telegram-bot-builder to create a standup bot. Every day at 9 AM in each team member's local timezone, send a private message asking three questions in sequence: "What did you complete yesterday?", "What are you working on today?", and "Any blockers?" Wait for each response before asking the next question. Store responses in a SQLite database with timestamp, user ID, and answers. If someone does not respond within 2 hours, send a single reminder. Mark them as "no update" after 4 hours.

### 2. Generate the daily team summary

Compile all individual responses into a formatted summary posted to the team channel.

> Use template-engine to render a daily standup summary. Once all team members have responded (or been marked as "no update"), compile a summary grouped by team: Backend (4 people), Frontend (4 people), DevOps (2 people), and QA (2 people). Format each person's update as a bullet list under their name. Highlight any reported blockers in bold. Post the summary to the #standups group channel at 2 PM UTC.

The bot posts a structured summary to the group channel that looks like this:

```text
Daily Standup -- Wednesday, Feb 18 2026
========================================
Responses: 11/12 (Maria: no update)

BACKEND
  Alex K.
    Done: Finished order API pagination
    Today: Start payment webhook retry logic
    Blockers: None

  Priya S.
    Done: Fixed N+1 query on product listing
    Today: Database migration for new user fields
    Blockers: **Waiting on schema approval from DBA**

FRONTEND
  Jordan M.
    Done: Shipped checkout redesign to staging
    Today: A/B test setup for new checkout flow
    Blockers: None
  ...

BLOCKERS REQUIRING ATTENTION (2):
  1. Priya S. -- Waiting on schema approval from DBA
  2. Tomas R. -- Staging environment down since Monday
```

The blockers section at the bottom surfaces items that need management attention without requiring anyone to scan through individual updates.

### 3. Compile weekly reports for stakeholders

Aggregate standup data from the week into a stakeholder-friendly progress report.

> Use batch-processor to aggregate standup data every Friday. For each team member, compile their daily updates into a weekly summary: tasks completed, tasks in progress, and recurring blockers. Use template-engine to render a stakeholder report with: team velocity (tasks completed this week vs. last week), active blockers requiring management attention, and per-person availability for the coming week. Post to the #weekly-reports channel and export as a PDF to /reports/weekly/.

### 4. Add team analytics and streak tracking

Track participation rates and response patterns to identify engagement issues early.

> Add analytics to the standup bot: track each person's response rate (percentage of standups completed), average response time, and current streak (consecutive days of standup submissions). Post a monthly participation leaderboard to the team channel. Alert the manager privately if anyone's response rate drops below 60% for two consecutive weeks. Store all metrics in the SQLite database for trend analysis.

## Real-World Example

A 12-person distributed team deployed the standup bot on a Monday. By the end of the first week, participation jumped from 65% (manual approach) to 94% because the bot sent personal reminders. The manager stopped spending 45 minutes on Friday summaries entirely since the bot generates them automatically. After one month, the team identified that their QA engineer in Singapore was consistently reporting the same blocker (waiting on staging deployments) for 8 out of 20 standups, which led to a process change that gave QA self-service staging access. The weekly stakeholder report became the most-read document in the company's Slack because it was consistently formatted and always on time.

## Tips

- Send the standup prompt at 9 AM in each person's local timezone, not a single global time. A prompt at 2 AM is ignored; a prompt at the start of someone's workday gets answered immediately.
- Limit each response field to 500 characters. This prevents the summary from being dominated by one person's essay and keeps updates scannable.
- Store standup data for at least 90 days. Recurring blockers only become visible when you can look back across weeks to spot patterns.
