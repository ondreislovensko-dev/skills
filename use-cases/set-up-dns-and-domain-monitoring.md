# Set Up Automated DNS and Domain Monitoring with AI

## The Problem

Your company manages 30+ domains across production services, marketing sites, and internal tools. DNS records get changed without documentation, domains expire because renewal emails go to a former employee's inbox, SSL certificates lapse over a weekend, and DNS propagation issues after a migration take hours to diagnose. You only find out when something breaks — a customer can't reach your site, email stops working, or a subdomain starts pointing to an old server.

## The Solution

Use **coding-agent** to build DNS monitoring scripts, **n8n-workflow** to set up automated checks and alerting, and **report-generator** to produce weekly domain health reports.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install coding-agent
npx terminal-skills install n8n-workflow
npx terminal-skills install report-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Inventory your domains and expected DNS state

Tell the agent what to monitor:

```
Set up DNS monitoring for our domains. Here's the list:
- example.com — production app, should have A record to 203.0.113.10
- api.example.com — CNAME to our load balancer at lb.example.com
- mail.example.com — MX records pointing to Google Workspace
- staging.example.com — A record to 203.0.113.20
- docs.example.com — CNAME to our-docs.netlify.app

Also monitor: domain expiration dates, SSL certificate expiry, and SPF/DKIM/DMARC records for email deliverability.
```

### 2. The agent builds the monitoring system

```
DNS Monitoring Setup Complete:

Created monitoring scripts:
- dns-checker.js — Resolves all DNS records and compares against expected values
- ssl-checker.js — Checks certificate expiry for all HTTPS endpoints
- domain-expiry.js — Queries WHOIS for registration expiration dates
- email-auth.js — Validates SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records

Current Status Scan:

| Domain              | DNS    | SSL Expiry    | Domain Expiry | Email Auth |
|---------------------|--------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| example.com         | ✅ OK  | 2026-08-14    | 2027-03-01    | ✅ SPF+DKIM |
| api.example.com     | ✅ OK  | 2026-08-14    | (subdomain)   | N/A        |
| mail.example.com    | ✅ OK  | N/A           | (subdomain)   | ✅ SPF+DKIM |
| staging.example.com | ⚠️ DRIFT| 2026-03-02   | (subdomain)   | N/A        |
| docs.example.com    | ✅ OK  | 2026-05-20    | (subdomain)   | N/A        |

⚠️ staging.example.com: A record points to 203.0.113.25 instead of expected 203.0.113.20
⚠️ staging.example.com: SSL certificate expires in 13 days!
```

### 3. Set up automated alerts

```
Create an n8n workflow that runs these checks every 6 hours and sends alerts to our Slack #ops channel when:
- Any DNS record doesn't match expected value
- SSL certificate expires within 30 days
- Domain expires within 60 days
- Email authentication records are missing or invalid
```

### 4. The agent generates the workflow

The agent creates an n8n workflow definition with scheduled triggers, DNS resolution nodes, comparison logic, and Slack notification integration — ready to import.

### 5. Generate a weekly domain health report

```
Every Monday, generate a domain health report summarizing the status of all domains, any changes detected in the past week, and upcoming expirations.
```

The agent sets up a weekly report template that shows the full domain inventory status, historical changes, and action items.

## Real-World Example

Jun is a platform engineer at a 35-person SaaS startup that acquired a smaller company last quarter, inheriting 12 additional domains. Nobody has a complete picture of all DNS records. Using the monitoring workflow:

1. Jun feeds the agent a list of all 40+ domains and subdomains across both companies
2. The initial scan reveals 3 domains with SSL certificates expiring within 2 weeks, 1 domain expiring in 45 days with renewal emails going to a deactivated email address, and 2 subdomains still pointing to decommissioned servers
3. The agent sets up monitoring that catches a DNS change the next week when a developer accidentally updates the production CNAME while configuring a test environment
4. The automated Slack alert fires within 30 minutes, and the change is reverted before any customer impact
5. Weekly reports give Jun confidence that the 40-domain portfolio is under control, and the CEO stops getting surprised by domain expiration notices

### What the Monitor Checks

Every 6 hours, the monitoring system validates:

- **A/AAAA records** — IP addresses match expected values
- **CNAME records** — aliases resolve to the correct targets
- **MX records** — mail routing is intact and priority order is correct
- **TXT records** — SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records haven't been accidentally deleted
- **NS records** — nameserver delegation hasn't changed unexpectedly
- **SSL certificates** — valid, not expiring soon, and chain is complete
- **WHOIS data** — domain registration expiry and registrant contact information
- **Propagation** — after any change, verify all major DNS resolvers return the new value

### Alert Severity Levels

The monitoring system uses tiered alerts:

- **Critical** — production domain DNS mismatch or SSL expired; pages on-call immediately
- **Warning** — SSL expiring within 30 days or staging DNS drift; Slack notification
- **Info** — domain expiring within 90 days or DNS TTL changes; included in weekly report only
