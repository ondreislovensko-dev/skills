# Automate Microsoft Office Document Workflows with Word and Access

## The Problem

Your operations team generates 40 client reports per month in Microsoft Word, each requiring data from a tracking spreadsheet with 15,000 rows across 8 tabs. The process is entirely manual: copy data from the spreadsheet into a Word template, format tables, update charts, and email. Each report takes 90 minutes, and formatting varies because different team members interpret the template differently.

The spreadsheet crashes weekly because Excel was never designed as a database at this scale. Three months ago, someone accidentally deleted a row containing a client's entire project history. Recovery took a full day, and two months of time entries were permanently lost from an unsynced local copy.

## The Solution

Use the **ms-access** skill to migrate the tracking spreadsheet into a proper Access database with relational tables and validation rules. Use the **microsoft-word** skill to generate formatted reports directly from database queries, eliminating manual copy-paste.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Design and migrate to an Access database

Convert the spreadsheet into a structured database:

> Analyze the 8 spreadsheet tabs (clients, projects, milestones, deliverables, time-entries, invoices, contacts, notes). Design an Access schema with relationships: clients have many projects, projects have milestones and deliverables, deliverables have time entries. Add validation rules and referential integrity. Import the 15,000 rows.

The migration creates 8 linked tables with enforced relationships. Referential integrity prevents accidental deletion -- you cannot remove a client with active projects. Required field validation ensures time entries always have a project ID and date.

### 2. Build query views for reporting

Create reusable queries that power monthly reports:

> Create Access queries for the client report: project status summary with completion percentages, milestone timeline for next 30 days, hours summary per project per month, and invoice aging. Each query accepts a client ID parameter.

The four parameterized queries return exactly the data each report section needs. Running a query takes under 2 seconds versus the manual process of filtering tabs, copying, and reformatting.

### 3. Generate Word reports from database queries

Automate report generation with templates populated from Access:

> Create a Word template for the monthly client report with sections: executive summary, project status table, milestone timeline, hours breakdown chart, and invoice status. Write a script that populates the template from Access queries, formats tables with corporate styling, and saves as both .docx and .pdf.

The template uses content controls mapped to database fields. Generating one report takes 10 seconds instead of 90 minutes. Tables are auto-formatted, charts update from live data, and headers include the correct client name and date range.

### 4. Set up batch generation with validation

Automate the monthly cycle for all clients:

> Create a batch process generating reports for all active clients at month-end. For each client, run queries, populate the template, save as PDF, and log results. Flag clients where data is missing or incomplete for manual review before sending.

The batch runs in under 7 minutes for all 40 clients. The log shows 37 complete reports and 3 flagged for review -- 2 with missing milestone dates and 1 with an unbilled deliverable.

### 5. Add data entry forms for non-technical users

Make the Access database accessible to operations staff:

> Create Access forms for common data entry tasks: adding new projects, logging time entries, updating milestone status, and recording invoice payments. Include dropdown lookups for client and project names so users do not need to remember IDs.

The forms replace direct table editing with a guided interface. Dropdown lookups prevent typos in client names, and validation rules catch missing required fields before saving. The operations team can maintain data quality without understanding the database schema.

## Real-World Example

A consulting firm's operations coordinator spent 60 hours per month generating client reports from a bloated spreadsheet. Filtering took 30 seconds per tab and pivot tables crashed regularly.

After migrating to Access and automating Word report generation, the monthly cycle dropped from 60 hours to 3: 30 minutes for the batch, 90 minutes reviewing flagged reports, and 60 minutes for spot-checks. The coordinator reallocated 57 hours per month to client relationship work.

Report quality improved because formatting was consistent and data came from validated queries. The accidental deletion problem disappeared because Access enforced referential integrity.
