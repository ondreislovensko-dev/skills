# Build a Microsoft Collaboration Hub with SharePoint, OneDrive, and OneNote

## The Problem

Your engineering team's documentation is scattered across personal OneDrive folders, random SharePoint sites from different eras, and OneNote notebooks nobody can find. New engineers ask where the deployment runbook is and get three different answers. Design assets live in one person's OneDrive and become inaccessible during vacations.

Architecture decision records exist in a OneNote notebook shared with 4 of 12 team members. The quarterly audit asks for project documentation and the team spends two days collecting files from different locations. When someone leaves, their personal OneDrive files become orphaned and require IT intervention to recover.

## The Solution

Use the **sharepoint** skill to build a structured team site with document libraries and metadata, the **onedrive** skill to organize file storage with consistent sharing policies, and the **onenote** skill to create searchable knowledge notebooks linked to the SharePoint site.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Design the SharePoint site structure

Create a central engineering hub with organized document libraries:

> Set up a SharePoint team site called "Engineering Hub" with document libraries: Architecture (ADRs and diagrams), Runbooks (deployment and incident procedures), Project Docs (organized by project), and Templates. Add metadata columns for document type, project name, owner, and last review date.

The SharePoint site becomes the canonical location for all documentation. Metadata columns enable filtering -- finding all runbooks for the payments service is a single click rather than a folder dive. The landing page includes quick links to most-accessed documents and a search bar indexing all libraries.

### 2. Organize OneDrive storage with synced libraries

Connect individual and team file storage to the central hub:

> Configure OneDrive sync for the Engineering Hub libraries so team members access files from their file explorer. Set up shared design assets at /Engineering/Design-Assets with read access for all engineers and write access for the design team. Migrate the 230 files in personal OneDrive folders into appropriate SharePoint libraries.

Files become accessible through both SharePoint and local file system via OneDrive sync. The migration preserves version history. Personal folders are replaced with shared libraries that survive employee turnover.

### 3. Create structured OneNote knowledge notebooks

Build searchable notebooks for knowledge that does not fit into formal documents:

> Create a "Engineering Knowledge Base" OneNote notebook with sections: Onboarding (setup guides, team structure), Debugging (common issues per service), Vendor Integrations (API quirks, contacts, SLAs), and Meeting Notes (by recurring meeting). Link from the Engineering Hub SharePoint site.

The Debugging section becomes particularly valuable -- when an engineer figures out why the Stripe webhook fails intermittently, they add a note with error message, root cause, and fix. The next person who sees that error finds the answer in seconds.

### 4. Set up governance and review cycles

Prevent documentation from going stale:

> Create a Power Automate flow checking "last review date" on all Engineering Hub documents. If not reviewed in 90 days, send a Teams notification to the owner. Generate a monthly documentation health report posted to #engineering.

Documents marked archived move to a separate library so they do not clutter search but remain accessible. The monthly report tracks review compliance as a team metric.

### 5. Create a content migration playbook

Document the process for bringing in documentation from new teams or acquisitions:

> Write a migration guide that covers: assessing existing documentation sources, mapping files to the correct SharePoint library, setting appropriate metadata, configuring OneDrive sync for new team members, and adding team-specific sections to the OneNote knowledge base.

The playbook ensures consistency as the organization grows. When a new team joins, their documentation is integrated into the hub within a week rather than creating yet another disconnected SharePoint site.

## Real-World Example

A 30-person engineering team at a healthcare company had documentation across 47 personal OneDrive folders, 8 SharePoint sites, and 12 OneNote notebooks shared with varying subsets. An auditor requested SOC 2 documentation and the team spent 3 days locating files.

After building the centralized hub, the next SOC 2 audit prep took 2 hours because a single SharePoint search returned every compliance-relevant document. New engineer onboarding dropped from 12 days to 6 because the OneNote onboarding section replaced messaging 5 different people for setup guides.

The 90-day review cycle caught 14 outdated runbooks in the first quarter that would have caused confusion during incidents.
