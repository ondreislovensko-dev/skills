# Create Automated Project Cost Estimation from Requirements with AI

## The Problem

A software consultancy spends 10-15 hours per week writing project estimates for potential clients. A senior developer reads the requirements document, guesses how long each feature will take based on gut feeling, adds a buffer, and hands numbers to the sales team who plugs them into a spreadsheet. Estimates vary wildly between developers — the same project gets quoted at 200 hours by one person and 400 by another. Win rates suffer because some estimates are too high (clients walk away) and others too low (the team eats the cost overrun). There is no historical data feedback loop — nobody checks whether past estimates were accurate.

## The Solution

Use the **data-analysis** skill to analyze past project data and build estimation benchmarks by feature type. Feed new requirements into the **proposal-writer** skill to break them into tasks, estimate effort, and apply risk-adjusted multipliers. Use the **excel-processor** skill to generate formatted cost breakdowns and comparison scenarios that the sales team can present.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install data-analysis
npx terminal-skills install proposal-writer
npx terminal-skills install excel-processor
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Build estimation benchmarks from past projects

Tell your AI agent:

```
Read our project history from /estimates/completed-projects.xlsx. Each row has: project name, feature category, estimated hours, actual hours, team size, and complexity rating. Calculate the average estimation accuracy by feature category. Show which categories we consistently overestimate and underestimate.
```

The agent uses **data-analysis** to compute:

```
Estimation Accuracy by Feature Category (24 past projects)

| Category | Avg Estimated | Avg Actual | Accuracy | Bias |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------|------|
| Auth/SSO | 40h | 52h | 77% | underestimate by 30% |
| CRUD endpoints | 24h | 22h | 92% | slight overestimate |
| Integrations (3rd party) | 30h | 48h | 63% | underestimate by 60% |
| Frontend forms | 16h | 18h | 89% | slight underestimate |
| Reporting/dashboards | 32h | 44h | 73% | underestimate by 38% |
| DevOps/infra | 20h | 28h | 71% | underestimate by 40% |
```

### 2. Analyze new project requirements

```
Read the requirements document at /estimates/new/acme-portal-requirements.pdf. Break it into individual features, classify each by our category system, and estimate hours using our historical benchmarks (adjusted for the accuracy bias we just calculated).
```

The **proposal-writer** decomposes the project:

```
Project: Client Portal — 14 features identified

| Feature | Category | Base Estimate | Bias Adjustment | Adjusted Hours |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| User auth with SSO | Auth/SSO | 40h | +30% | 52h |
| User profile CRUD | CRUD endpoints | 12h | — | 12h |
| Stripe billing integration | Integrations | 30h | +60% | 48h |
| Admin dashboard | Reporting | 28h | +38% | 39h |
| File upload/download | CRUD endpoints | 16h | — | 16h |
| Email notifications | Integrations | 20h | +60% | 32h |
| Role-based access | Auth/SSO | 24h | +30% | 31h |
... 7 more features

Total adjusted estimate: 378 hours
Confidence range: 340-420 hours (based on historical variance)
```

### 3. Generate cost scenarios

```
Create three cost scenarios: optimistic (340h), expected (378h), and pessimistic (420h). Apply our blended rate of $150/hour. Add line items for project management (15% overhead), QA (20% of dev hours), and a 10% contingency buffer. Output as a formatted Excel spreadsheet.
```

The **excel-processor** produces:

```
Cost Estimate — Client Portal

| Line Item | Optimistic | Expected | Pessimistic |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Development | $51,000 | $56,700 | $63,000 |
| QA (20%) | $10,200 | $11,340 | $12,600 |
| Project Management (15%) | $7,650 | $8,505 | $9,450 |
| Contingency (10%) | $6,885 | $7,655 | $8,505 |
| **Total** | **$75,735** | **$84,200** | **$93,555** |

Timeline: 8-10 weeks with a team of 3
```

### 4. Compare against similar past projects

```
Find the 3 most similar completed projects from our history based on feature mix and scope. Show how their estimates compared to actuals and use that to validate our current estimate.
```

```
Similar Projects:

1. "Partner Portal" (2024-Q2) — 12 features, estimated 320h, actual 365h (+14%)
2. "Customer Dashboard" (2024-Q1) — 10 features, estimated 280h, actual 310h (+11%)
3. "Vendor Management App" (2024-Q3) — 15 features, estimated 400h, actual 425h (+6%)

Average overrun: +10%. Our adjusted estimate (378h) already accounts for historical bias.
Recommendation: present the "expected" scenario as the primary quote.
```

### 5. Generate the client-ready proposal

```
Create a client-facing cost proposal PDF. Include the feature breakdown, timeline, cost scenarios, team composition, and assumptions. Use our proposal template at /templates/proposal-template.html.
```

## Real-World Example

Alex runs sales at a 12-person software consultancy. Estimation used to take a senior developer half a day per proposal, with accuracy varying by 50% between estimators. After building benchmarks from 24 completed projects, Alex discovered the team consistently underestimated integrations by 60% — explaining why those projects always overran. The agent now produces bias-corrected estimates in 15 minutes. The sales team presents three scenarios to clients instead of a single number. Win rates improved by 20% because quotes are realistic, and project overruns dropped from 40% to under 15% in two quarters.
