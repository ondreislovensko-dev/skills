# Create an Automated Employee Skills Gap Analysis with AI

## The Problem

Your engineering team is about to take on a major project requiring Kubernetes, event-driven architecture, and real-time data processing — but you're not sure who has these skills. The engineering manager sends a survey, gets inconsistent self-assessments, and ends up with a spreadsheet that doesn't translate into action. Meanwhile, hiring decisions are based on gut feeling rather than actual capability gaps, and training budgets go to whoever asks loudest rather than where they'd have the most impact.

## The Solution

Use **data-analysis** to process skills data and identify gaps, **report-generator** to produce individual development plans and team-level summaries, and **web-research** to recommend specific training resources.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install data-analysis
npx terminal-skills install report-generator
npx terminal-skills install web-research
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define the skills framework

Tell the agent what skills matter for your team:

```
Create a skills gap analysis for our 12-person engineering team. Required skills for the next quarter's projects:
- Kubernetes (deployment, scaling, debugging)
- Event-driven architecture (Kafka, message queues)
- Real-time data processing (streaming, WebSockets)
- TypeScript (advanced types, generics)
- PostgreSQL (query optimization, partitioning)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, automated testing)

Here's the team skills survey results: skills-survey.csv
```

### 2. The agent analyzes the data

```
Skills Gap Analysis — Engineering Team (12 members)

Skill Coverage Map (1-5 scale, 3+ = proficient):

| Skill                | Team Avg | Proficient | Gap    |
|----------------------|----------|------------|--------|
| TypeScript           | 3.8      | 10/12      | Low    |
| PostgreSQL           | 3.2      | 8/12       | Low    |
| CI/CD                | 3.0      | 7/12       | Medium |
| Kubernetes           | 1.9      | 2/12       | HIGH   |
| Event-driven arch    | 2.1      | 3/12       | HIGH   |
| Real-time processing | 1.6      | 1/12       | HIGH   |

Critical gaps: Only 2 team members are proficient in Kubernetes,
and only 1 can handle real-time data processing independently.
```

### 3. Get individual development plans

```
Generate a personalized development plan for each team member based on their current skills and the team's gaps. Prioritize so we cover the critical gaps fastest.
```

### 4. The agent creates targeted plans

```
Individual Development Plans:

ALEX (Current: TypeScript 5, PostgreSQL 4, Kubernetes 1)
Priority: Kubernetes — best candidate due to strong infrastructure interest
- Week 1-2: Complete "Kubernetes for Developers" on KodeKloud
- Week 3-4: Deploy the staging environment to k8s with mentor support
- Week 5-6: Handle one production k8s debugging session with oversight
Target: Kubernetes proficiency level 3 within 6 weeks

NORA (Current: TypeScript 4, Event-driven 2, Real-time 2)
Priority: Real-time processing — has event-driven foundation to build on
- Week 1-2: Study WebSocket patterns with the Socket.io docs and build a prototype
- Week 3-4: Implement real-time notifications feature in the product
- Week 5-6: Lead the streaming data pipeline design session
Target: Real-time processing level 3 within 6 weeks

[... plans for all 12 team members]
```

### 5. Generate the management summary

```
Create an executive summary with hiring recommendations if training alone won't close the gaps in time.
```

The agent produces a report showing which gaps training can close, which require hiring, and the estimated timeline and cost for each option.

## Real-World Example

Femi is the engineering manager at a 20-person SaaS startup that just landed a contract requiring real-time analytics — a capability the team hasn't built before. Using the skills gap analysis:

1. Femi collects self-assessments from all 12 engineers via a simple 1-5 rating spreadsheet
2. The agent cross-references skills with the project requirements and identifies that real-time processing is the most critical gap with only one semi-proficient engineer
3. Development plans are generated — two engineers with strong data backgrounds are fast-tracked for streaming training
4. The agent recommends hiring one senior engineer with Kafka experience rather than training everyone, saving 8 weeks of ramp-up time
5. Femi uses the report to justify the hire to the CEO and allocate the $4,800 training budget to the three highest-impact development plans

- [report-generator](../skills/report-generator/) -- Generate individual plans and executive summaries
- [web-research](../skills/web-research/) -- Find relevant training courses and learning resources

### Making Skills Data Actionable

The agent helps translate analysis into outcomes:

- **Pair programming assignments** — match experts with learners on real project tasks
- **Conference and training budget allocation** — direct spending to the highest-impact gaps
- **Hiring criteria** — define must-have skills for open roles based on gap data, not wishful thinking
- **Project staffing** — assign team members to projects that stretch their skills in needed areas
