# Build a Telegram Bot That Runs Your Business Operations

## The Problem

A small agency with 8 employees manages client communication across email, phone, and random WhatsApp messages. Appointment bookings happen through phone calls — the receptionist juggles a paper calendar and Google Calendar, double-bookings happen twice a month. Order status inquiries account for 40% of incoming calls, each taking 3-5 minutes to look up. The team coordinates through a group chat, but important messages get buried under casual conversation. There is no single system that ties customer-facing and internal operations together.

## The Solution

Use `telegram-bot-builder` to create an interactive bot with inline keyboards and conversation flows, `coding-agent` to implement the booking engine and order tracking logic, and `data-analysis` to generate weekly business reports from bot usage data.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install telegram-bot-builder coding-agent data-analysis
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Build the customer-facing order tracker

```
Build a Telegram bot using grammY that lets customers check their order
status. When a user sends /start, show a welcome message with two inline
keyboard buttons: "Track Order" and "New Order". For order tracking: ask
for the order number, query the database, and return status with a
progress bar emoji (⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜ → 🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜ → 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩).
Include estimated delivery date and a "Notify me on update" button that
subscribes them to push notifications when status changes. Use SQLite
for the database.
```

The agent creates a grammY bot with a conversation plugin for multi-step order tracking, inline keyboard navigation, status visualization with progress bars, and a notification subscription system that pushes updates when the order status changes in the database.

### 2. Add appointment booking with calendar

```
Add a booking flow to the bot. When the user taps "Book Appointment":
1. Show service categories as inline keyboard buttons (Consultation, Follow-up, Review)
2. Show available dates for the next 14 days (skip weekends and fully booked days)
3. Show available time slots for the selected date (30-min intervals, 9am-5pm)
4. Confirm booking with a summary and Confirm/Cancel buttons
5. Send a confirmation message with an .ics calendar attachment
6. Send a reminder 24 hours before the appointment

Handle edge cases: slot taken between selection and confirmation,
cancellation flow, rescheduling.
```

The agent implements a full booking engine with date picker keyboards (showing day names and available slot counts), time slot selection with real-time availability checks, race condition handling with database-level locks, .ics file generation, and a cron job for 24-hour reminders.

### 3. Build internal team coordination

```
Create a separate bot (or admin mode in the same bot) for the team:
- /tasks — show today's tasks assigned to each team member
- /assign @person "task description" — create and assign a task
- /daily — post a daily summary: pending tasks, today's appointments,
  new orders, unread customer messages
- /broadcast "message" — send a message to all subscribed customers
  (with confirmation step before sending)

Only allow team members (list of Telegram user IDs in config) to access
admin commands. Log all actions with timestamps.
```

The agent adds an admin middleware checking user IDs against a config list, task management with SQLite persistence, a daily digest assembling data from orders, bookings, and tasks tables, and a broadcast function with preview and confirmation step that sends to customers in batches (respecting Telegram's 30 msg/sec rate limit).

### 4. Implement payment collection

```
Add payment integration using Telegram's built-in payments (Stripe provider).
When a customer places a new order through the bot:
1. Show order summary with itemized pricing
2. Send a Telegram invoice with the Pay button
3. Handle successful payment callback
4. Update order status to "paid" and notify the team channel
5. Send a receipt with order details

Also add a /pay command where customers can pay outstanding invoices by number.
```

The agent integrates Telegram Payments API with Stripe as the provider, generating invoices with line items, handling pre-checkout queries for validation, processing successful payments with database updates, and sending formatted receipts. Team notifications go to the admin group with payment amount and customer details.

### 5. Generate weekly business analytics

```
Every Monday at 8am, generate a weekly report and post it to the team group:
- Total orders: count and revenue
- Bookings: completed vs cancelled vs no-show
- Bot engagement: unique users, messages processed, most used features
- Customer satisfaction: count of users who used "Rate us" feature
- Comparison with previous week (↑/↓ indicators)

Format as a clean Telegram message with emoji headers and percentage changes.
```

The agent creates a reporting module that queries SQLite for the past 7 days, calculates week-over-week changes, and formats the report with section headers, trend indicators (📈/📉), and a summary score. Posted automatically via node-cron.

## Real-World Example

The owner of a 8-person service agency spends 2 hours daily on phone calls for order status and appointment booking. Double-bookings cost them one upset client per month. Team coordination happens in a messy group chat.

1. She deploys the Telegram bot — customers check order status instantly, reducing phone calls by 60%
2. The booking system eliminates double-bookings entirely with real-time slot locking
3. Daily digest keeps the team aligned without scrolling through hundreds of messages
4. Payment collection through Telegram reduces invoice follow-up time from days to minutes
5. After 3 months: phone call volume drops 70%, booking no-shows decrease 40% (thanks to reminders), and the team saves 15+ hours per week on coordination
