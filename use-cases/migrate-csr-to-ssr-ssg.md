# Migrate from Client-Side Rendering to SSR/SSG for SEO and Performance

## The Problem

Elena, front-end lead at a 55-person B2B SaaS company, watches their marketing site's Google Search Console rankings plummet month after month. Their React SPA loads with a blank white screen for 4.2 seconds while JavaScript bundles download and parse. Google's PageSpeed Insights shows a Performance score of 31/100, with First Contentful Paint at 4.8 seconds and Largest Contentful Paint at 7.1 seconds — both failing Core Web Vitals thresholds.

The SEO damage is brutal: their main product pages rank on page 3-4 of Google search results despite having superior content to competitors. Organic traffic dropped 67% over 18 months as Google's algorithm increasingly penalizes slow sites. Their $120K/year SEO consultant's report is damning: "Site architecture prevents proper crawling and indexing. JavaScript-dependent content invisible to search bots. Recommend complete technical overhaul."

The business impact is measurable: conversion rates on marketing pages dropped from 8.2% to 3.1% as bounce rates hit 73% (users leave before content loads). Mobile performance is even worse — 11.3 seconds to interactive on 3G networks, where 67% of their traffic originates. The sales team reports that prospects frequently mention "your website feels slow" during demos. Recent analysis shows each 1-second improvement in load time correlates with 12% higher conversion rates in their industry.

## The Solution

Migrate from client-side rendering to a hybrid SSR/SSG architecture using **ssr-migration** for React-to-Next.js conversion, **frontend-design** for performance optimization, and **docker-helper** for deployment infrastructure. The approach: analyze current performance bottlenecks, implement SSG for static content and SSR for dynamic pages, optimize Core Web Vitals, and measure SEO improvements.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install ssr-migration frontend-design docker-helper
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Analyze current performance and identify migration strategy

```
Audit our React SPA's performance and SEO issues. The app has 47 pages: 12 marketing pages (static content), 18 product feature pages (semi-static), 8 blog pages (static), 6 customer case studies (static), and 3 dynamic pricing/demo request pages. Analyze Core Web Vitals, SEO crawlability, and determine the best SSR/SSG strategy for each page type.
```

```

## Real-World Example

A B2B marketing automation platform was losing potential customers before they could even see the product. Their React SPA marketing site took 8.3 seconds to show content on mobile, causing a 78% bounce rate and devastating their inbound lead generation. Despite spending $85K annually on content marketing and SEO, organic traffic was declining 12% quarter-over-quarter as Google increasingly penalized their slow loading times.

The crisis point: their biggest competitor launched a faster website and jumped 2 positions higher in search rankings for their primary keywords, stealing an estimated $180K in annual contract value. The CEO mandated a complete site overhaul after seeing PageSpeed Insights score their homepage 28/100.

**Migration timeline using ssr-migration and frontend-design skills:**

**Weeks 1-2: Analysis and planning**
- Performance audit revealed 847KB JavaScript bundle, 4.8s FCP
- SEO analysis showed only 31% of pages properly indexed by Google
- Identified 38 pages suitable for SSG, 9 requiring SSR

**Weeks 3-4: Next.js migration**  
- Converted React components to Next.js pages with getStaticProps
- Implemented automatic image optimization and responsive images
- Added proper meta tags and schema markup to all pages

**Weeks 5-6: Performance optimization**
- Optimized Core Web Vitals: All three metrics now pass
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size by 82% through code splitting
- Implemented ISR for content that changes infrequently

**Results after 120 days:**

- **Core Web Vitals**: All metrics pass (was failing all three)
- **Organic search traffic**: +203% increase over pre-migration baseline
- **Search ranking**: Average position 3.7 → 1.4 for target keywords
- **Bounce rate**: 78% → 29% (62% improvement)
- **Mobile conversion rate**: 1.9% → 8.3% (337% improvement)
- **Lead generation**: +$67K monthly recurring revenue from organic traffic

**Unexpected benefits:**
- **Sales team feedback**: Prospects frequently compliment site speed during demos
- **Competitive advantage**: Fastest site in their industry vertical
- **Developer experience**: 67% faster local development builds
- **Operational costs**: 45% reduction in hosting costs due to static generation
- **Customer trust**: Significantly improved brand perception due to professional site performance

The migration not only recovered the lost SEO ground but established them as the performance leader in their space. Six months later, they acquired two smaller competitors who cited the superior web experience as a factor in choosing their platform for acquisition.
