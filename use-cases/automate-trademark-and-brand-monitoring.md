# Automate Trademark and Brand Monitoring with AI

## The Problem

A growing startup has a recognizable brand name and logo but no budget for a brand protection agency. The founder occasionally googles the company name and finds knockoff products on marketplaces, copycat domains, and social media accounts using their logo without permission. Each discovery is accidental. By the time they notice an infringement, the knockoff has been live for months. Filing takedowns requires documenting each case with screenshots, URLs, and timestamps — tedious work that nobody owns. Meanwhile the legal team at a competitor once sent them a cease-and-desist over a color shade, so the founder also wants to make sure their own brand usage stays consistent.

## The Solution

Use the **web-research** skill to systematically search for brand mentions, similar domain registrations, and marketplace listings. Deploy the **web-scraper** skill to capture evidence — screenshots, page content, and metadata — for each potential infringement. Use the **report-generator** skill to compile findings into a structured report ready for legal review or DMCA takedowns.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install web-research
npx terminal-skills install web-scraper
npx terminal-skills install report-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define the brand assets to monitor

Tell your AI agent:

```
Our brand name is "Lightbeam" and our domain is lightbeam.io. Monitor for: (1) domains containing "lightbeam" or common typosquats (lightbeam.co, lightbearn.com, etc.), (2) marketplace listings on Amazon, Shopify stores, and Gumroad using our name or logo, (3) social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram using "lightbeam" in the handle, (4) any GitHub repos using "lightbeam" in a way that implies official affiliation.
```

### 2. Scan for potential infringements

The agent uses **web-research** to search across multiple channels:

```
Brand Monitoring Scan — "Lightbeam"

Domain squatting:
  ⚠️ lightbeam.co — registered, parked page with ads
  ⚠️ lightbearn.com — typosquat, redirects to a competitor
  ⚠️ getlightbeam.io — registered, shows "coming soon"

Marketplace listings:
  🔴 Amazon ASIN B0CX4R2T — "Lightbeam Pro Dashboard" — uses our logo, not our product
  ⚠️ Gumroad: "Lightbeam Templates" — sells templates branded with our name

Social media:
  🔴 @lightbeam_official (Instagram) — impersonation, uses our logo
  ⚠️ @lightbeamhq (Twitter) — inactive, registered 2 months ago
  ✅ /company/lightbeam (LinkedIn) — this is our verified page

Code/repos:
  ✅ github.com/lightbeam-io — our org
  ⚠️ github.com/randomuser/lightbeam-sdk — unofficial, claims to be "official SDK"
```

### 3. Capture evidence for each case

```
For each 🔴 and ⚠️ finding, capture a screenshot, save the full page HTML, record the current WHOIS data for domains, and note the date. Store everything in /brand-monitoring/evidence/2025-01-20/.
```

The **web-scraper** skill archives each page:

```
Evidence captured:

lightbeam.co/
  screenshot.png — parked page with ad network
  whois.txt — registered 2024-09-15, registrant redacted
  page.html — full HTML snapshot

Amazon ASIN B0CX4R2T/
  screenshot.png — product listing using our logo
  listing.html — full listing content
  seller-info.txt — seller name: "TechGoods LLC"
```

### 4. Generate takedown-ready reports

```
Compile all findings into a brand monitoring report. For each confirmed infringement, draft a DMCA takedown notice template with the specific URLs, evidence file paths, and a description of the infringement. Separate findings by priority: impersonation (highest), trademark use in products, domain squatting.
```

The **report-generator** produces:

```
Brand Monitoring Report — January 20, 2025

Priority 1 — Impersonation (2 cases):
  1. Instagram @lightbeam_official
     Evidence: /evidence/2025-01-20/instagram-lightbeam-official/
     Recommended action: Instagram impersonation report form
     Draft notice: attached

  2. Amazon listing B0CX4R2T
     Evidence: /evidence/2025-01-20/amazon-B0CX4R2T/
     Recommended action: Amazon Brand Registry complaint
     Draft notice: attached

Priority 2 — Domain squatting (3 cases):
  ... details with UDRP complaint templates

Priority 3 — Unauthorized use (2 cases):
  ... details with cease-and-desist templates
```

### 5. Set up recurring scans

```
Create a monitoring schedule that runs this scan weekly. Compare each week's results against the previous scan and only surface new findings. Track the status of previously reported cases (submitted, acknowledged, resolved).
```

## Real-World Example

Marta is the co-founder of a 15-person startup. She discovered by accident that someone was selling fake "Lightbeam Pro" licenses on Amazon and an Instagram account was impersonating their brand. She asked the agent to run a full brand scan. In 20 minutes she had seven findings with archived evidence and pre-drafted takedown notices. She submitted the Amazon complaint the same day and the listing was removed within 72 hours. The weekly scan now catches new infringements within days instead of months, and Marta has a clean evidence trail for every case.
