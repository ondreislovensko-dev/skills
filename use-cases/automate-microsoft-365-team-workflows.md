# Automate Microsoft 365 Team Communication Workflows

## The Problem

Your engineering team uses Microsoft Teams for chat, Outlook for email, and Outlook Calendar for meetings. The daily workflow involves constant context-switching: checking Teams for standup updates, sending follow-up emails after meetings, manually creating calendar events from Teams decisions, and copying action items between platforms.

A typical engineering manager spends 45 minutes per day on this coordination work. When someone forgets to send the follow-up email or misses a calendar invite, action items fall through the cracks and resurface as missed deadlines two weeks later. Last month, a critical architecture review was delayed by a week because the calendar invite discussed in a Teams thread was never created.

## The Solution

Use the **microsoft-teams** skill for posting structured notifications and reading channel messages, the **outlook-email** skill for composing and sending follow-up emails, and the **calendar-integration** skill for creating and managing events, all coordinated in a single automated workflow.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Set up automated meeting follow-ups

Create a workflow that reads meeting notes from Teams and generates follow-up emails:

> After each meeting in the #engineering-standups Teams channel, extract the action items from the posted notes. For each action item, compose an Outlook email to the assigned person with the task description, deadline, and a link back to the Teams message. CC the engineering manager.

The workflow parses meeting notes, identifies action items by looking for assigned names and due dates (patterns like "@sarah - finish API docs by Friday"), and drafts individual emails. Each email includes the task, who assigned it, the deadline, and a deep link to the Teams message.

### 2. Automate meeting scheduling from Teams decisions

When someone proposes a meeting in Teams, create the calendar event automatically:

> Monitor #engineering-planning for messages containing "let's schedule", "set up a meeting", or "book time". Check calendar availability for all mentioned participants and create an Outlook calendar event at the first available 30-minute slot within the next 3 business days. Post a confirmation to the Teams thread.

The calendar integration checks free/busy status across all mentioned participants, finds the earliest common opening respecting working hours and timezones, creates the event with a Teams meeting link, and confirms back to the thread.

### 3. Create a daily digest workflow

Consolidate the day's communications into a single actionable summary:

> At 5 PM every workday, compile a digest: unresolved action items from Teams channels, calendar events for tomorrow with their agendas, and Outlook emails flagged for follow-up. Post to #engineering-daily and email the engineering manager.

The digest pulls from three sources, deduplicates items appearing in both Teams and email, and presents a consolidated view. Tomorrow's meetings list attendees who have not accepted yet, so the manager can follow up on tentative RSVPs.

### 4. Set up escalation notifications for overdue items

Automate reminders with an escalation chain:

> Track action items from follow-up emails. If not complete within 24 hours of deadline, send a Teams DM reminder. If still incomplete after 48 hours, post to #engineering-leads and email the engineering manager with all overdue items.

The escalation starts gentle with a private DM and increases visibility over time. Each notification includes the original action item, who assigned it, the deadline, and how many days overdue.

### 5. Build cross-platform status tracking

Create a unified view of commitments across all three platforms:

> Build a weekly status report that shows all open action items across Teams channels, email threads, and calendar follow-ups. Group by assignee and sort by deadline. Post every Monday morning to #engineering-standups so the team starts the week with a clear picture of commitments.

The Monday report prevents the week from starting with unknown obligations scattered across platforms. Each item links to its source so people can quickly review context.

## Real-World Example

An engineering manager at a 50-person company spent 45 minutes daily on meeting follow-ups, calendar coordination, and Teams monitoring. After automation, follow-up emails went out within 5 minutes of each meeting ending. Calendar events were created from Teams discussions without manual intervention.

The daily digest replaced 20 minutes of end-of-day scanning. The manager reclaimed roughly 3 hours per week. Action item completion rates improved from 68% to 91% over two months because the escalation chain made overdue items visible before they became missed deadlines.

The team stopped losing decisions made in Teams threads that nobody followed up on via email or calendar.
