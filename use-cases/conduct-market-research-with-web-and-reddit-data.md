# Conduct Market Research with Web and Reddit Data

## The Problem

A product team at an early-stage startup is building a database GUI tool and needs to validate their positioning before launch. Traditional market research costs $15,000-$50,000 for a survey-based study and takes 6-8 weeks.

The team needs faster, cheaper signal on three questions: What frustrations do developers have with existing database tools? Which competitors are gaining or losing mindshare? What features do people actually ask for versus what competitors market? The answers exist in public forums, blog posts, and Reddit threads, but manually trawling through hundreds of discussions is impractical. The team tried reading Reddit threads for a week and gave up after collecting scattered notes with no systematic way to quantify what they found.

## The Solution

Use the **web-research** skill to survey the competitive landscape, industry reports, and product review sites, then use **reddit-insights** and **reddit-readonly** skills to mine developer subreddits for unfiltered opinions, pain points, and feature requests about database tools.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Map the competitive landscape from web sources

Survey the market to identify competitors, their positioning, and recent developments:

> Research the database GUI tool market. Identify the top 10 competitors including TablePlus, DBeaver, DataGrip, Beekeeper Studio, DbVisualizer, pgAdmin, Sequel Pro/Ace, HeidiSQL, Navicat, and Azure Data Studio. For each, find: pricing model (free/freemium/paid), primary supported databases, most recent major release date, and their stated positioning (who they say the tool is for). Also search for recent funding rounds, acquisitions, or shutdown announcements in this space from the past 12 months. Check Product Hunt for any new database tools launched in the last 6 months.

Web research gives you the "official" competitive landscape: what companies say about themselves. Reddit research, in the next step, gives you what customers actually think. The gap between the two is where positioning opportunities live.

### 2. Analyze Reddit discussions about database tools

Mine developer subreddits for authentic opinions and pain points:

> Search Reddit across r/programming, r/webdev, r/devops, r/PostgreSQL, r/mysql, and r/databases for discussions about database GUI tools from the past 12 months. Find threads where people ask for recommendations, complain about existing tools, or compare options. Extract: the most frequently mentioned pain points (categorize into themes like performance, pricing, UI/UX, feature gaps, platform support), which tools get recommended most often and why, which tools generate the most complaints and what about, and any specific feature requests that appear in multiple threads. Focus on comments with high upvotes as signals of community agreement.

High-upvote comments are the closest thing to a free focus group. When 200 developers upvote a comment saying "DBeaver is powerful but the UI feels like it was designed for Java developers in 2005," that is a validated insight worth more than any survey response.

### 3. Deep-dive into competitor sentiment on Reddit

Read specific high-value threads to understand nuanced opinions:

> Find and analyze the 5 most upvoted Reddit threads from the past year that discuss database GUI tool comparisons or recommendations. For each thread, read the top 20 comments and extract: the commenter's stated use case and tech stack, which tool they recommend and the specific reason, which tool they switched away from and why, and any features they wish existed. Pay special attention to comments that describe switching between tools, as these reveal the moments competitors lose customers. Compile a list of the top 10 "switching triggers" that make developers change database tools.

Switching triggers are the most actionable insights for positioning. If developers switch away from Navicat because of price increases and away from pgAdmin because of poor multi-database support, those are two distinct market entry angles.

### 4. Identify underserved segments and positioning gaps

Cross-reference web research with Reddit signals to find market opportunities:

> Compare the competitive landscape data with the Reddit sentiment analysis. Identify gaps: Which user needs mentioned frequently on Reddit are not addressed by any top competitor? Which price points are underserved (what do people say about pricing)? Are there specific database engines (like ClickHouse, CockroachDB, or PlanetScale) that lack good GUI support but have growing communities? Which user segments (solo developers, database administrators, data analysts, DevOps engineers) feel underserved by current tools? Rank the top 5 positioning opportunities by market size signal (frequency of mentions) and competition intensity (number of existing solutions).

The intersection of "frequently requested" and "no good solution exists" is where new products find traction. A feature that gets mentioned in 15 Reddit threads with no satisfactory answer represents validated unmet demand.

### 5. Generate the market research report

Compile all findings into an actionable research brief for the product team:

> Compile the research into a market brief with these sections: Market Overview (size estimate, growth signals, key players), Customer Pain Points (ranked by frequency from Reddit data, with representative quotes), Competitive Gaps (features no one does well, underserved segments, pricing opportunities), Positioning Recommendation (the single strongest angle for our product based on the data, explained in 3-4 sentences), and Risks (competitor moves in progress that could close our window, segments that are already well-served). Keep the report under 1,500 words. End with 5 specific product decisions the team should make based on this research.

The report should end with decisions, not just information. "Here is what the market looks like" is interesting. "Based on this data, we should target developers using newer cloud databases, price at $8/month, and lead with connection speed as our primary differentiator" is actionable.

## Real-World Example

The research reveals three findings that reshape the product strategy. First, Reddit threads consistently complain that DBeaver's UI feels outdated and TablePlus is praised for aesthetics but criticized for lacking advanced query features. This suggests a gap for a tool that combines modern UI with power-user capabilities. Second, web research shows that ClickHouse, CockroachDB, and PlanetScale have collectively raised $900M in funding in the last 2 years, but none of the top GUI tools support all three natively. Reddit threads in those database-specific subreddits confirm users are frustrated with workarounds.

Third, pricing analysis reveals that DataGrip at $199/year and Navicat at $399/year leave a gap between free open-source tools and premium offerings. The team repositions: a modern, fast GUI tool at $8/month that natively supports newer cloud databases, targeting the developer segment that outgrew free tools but finds the incumbents overpriced or outdated. The entire research process takes 2 days instead of 6 weeks and costs nothing beyond team time.
