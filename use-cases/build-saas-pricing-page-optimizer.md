# Build an Automated SaaS Pricing Page Optimizer with AI

## The Problem

Your SaaS pricing page hasn't been updated in months. You suspect you're leaving money on the table — maybe the tiers are wrong, the feature breakdown is confusing, or the anchor pricing isn't working. But redesigning a pricing page means researching competitors, analyzing what converts, running A/B tests, and iterating. A product manager might spend two weeks on this, and still not know if the new page actually performs better.

## The Solution

Use **pricing-strategy** to analyze your current tiers and positioning, **page-cro** to audit conversion elements, **competitor-alternatives** to benchmark against similar products, and **web-research** to gather pricing psychology best practices.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install pricing-strategy
npx terminal-skills install page-cro
npx terminal-skills install competitor-alternatives
npx terminal-skills install web-research
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit your current pricing page

Give the agent your pricing URL:

```
Analyze our pricing page at https://app.example.com/pricing. Evaluate the tier structure, feature presentation, CTAs, and any conversion friction. Compare against SaaS pricing best practices.
```

### 2. The agent identifies issues

```
Pricing Page Audit — 7 issues found:

1. CRITICAL: No free tier or trial CTA — 68% of top SaaS products offer a free entry point
2. HIGH: Feature comparison table has 24 rows — cognitive overload, best practice is 8-12 key features
3. HIGH: Enterprise tier has no price anchor — "Contact Sales" without a starting price reduces conversions by ~30%
4. MEDIUM: Monthly/annual toggle defaults to monthly — defaulting to annual with savings badge increases annual signups
5. MEDIUM: No social proof near pricing — missing customer count, logos, or testimonials
6. LOW: CTA buttons all say "Get Started" — differentiating CTAs per tier improves click-through
7. LOW: No FAQ section — pricing pages with FAQ have 12% lower bounce rates
```

### 3. Research competitor pricing

```
Find 5 direct competitors in the project management SaaS space and compare their pricing tiers, feature packaging, and price points against ours.
```

### 4. The agent delivers a comparison matrix

```
Competitor Pricing Comparison:

| Feature         | You ($29/$79/$199) | Comp A ($12/$25/$59) | Comp B (Free/$15/$49) | Comp C ($19/$49/$99) |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Free tier       | No                 | No                    | Yes (3 users)          | No                   |
| Seat pricing    | Flat per tier      | Per user              | Per user               | Flat per tier        |
| API access      | Enterprise only    | All paid tiers        | Pro+                   | All paid tiers       |
| Annual discount | None shown         | 20%                   | 17%                    | 25%                  |

Key insight: Your mid-tier at $79 is 58% higher than the competitor average of $46.
API access gated to Enterprise is unusual — 3 of 4 competitors include it in mid-tier.
```

### 5. Generate an optimized pricing page spec

```
Based on the audit and competitor research, propose a new pricing structure with copy for each tier, feature allocation, and CTA text. Include the rationale for each change.
```

The agent produces a complete pricing page specification with recommended tiers, price points, feature distribution, and conversion copy ready for your design team.

## Real-World Example

Marta is the head of product at a 20-person SaaS startup selling a developer tool. Their pricing page converts at 2.1% — below the industry benchmark of 3-5%. Using the pricing optimizer workflow:

1. Marta feeds the current pricing page URL to the agent for a full CRO audit
2. The agent flags that the "Pro" tier bundles too many features, making the cheaper tier look weak
3. Competitor analysis reveals that similar tools offer a free tier with generous limits, which the startup lacks
4. The agent proposes a restructured four-tier model: Free (2 projects), Starter at $19 (10 projects), Pro at $49 (unlimited), and Enterprise with custom pricing
5. After implementing the new page, the team sees pricing page conversion climb to 3.8% within six weeks

## Tips for Pricing Optimization

- **Test one variable at a time** — changing tiers, prices, and copy simultaneously makes it impossible to know what worked
- **Watch for plan cannibalization** — if everyone picks the cheapest tier, your feature allocation between tiers needs work
- **Localize pricing** — purchasing power varies dramatically by region; consider geo-based pricing
- **Anchor with the mid-tier** — most SaaS products make the most revenue from the middle plan; design it as the obvious choice
- **Review quarterly** — competitor pricing shifts, your product evolves, and customer expectations change; stale pricing costs revenue
- **Include a calculator** — usage-based components need a cost estimator to reduce purchase anxiety

### Common Pricing Page Mistakes

Avoid these patterns the agent checks for:

- **Hidden pricing** — requiring a demo call for any tier loses self-serve buyers
- **Too many tiers** — more than four options creates decision paralysis
- **Feature overload** — listing every feature instead of highlighting differentiators
- **No social proof** — pricing pages without testimonials or customer counts convert 20-30% worse
- **Unclear upgrade path** — users should know exactly what they get by moving up a tier

### Measuring Success

After implementing changes, track these metrics:

- **Pricing page conversion rate** — visitors who click a CTA divided by total pricing page views
- **Plan distribution** — percentage of signups per tier; healthy distribution means the mid-tier wins
- **Revenue per visitor** — total revenue divided by pricing page visits
- **Trial-to-paid conversion** — if you add a free tier, measure how many convert within 14 days
- **Churn by plan** — check if cheaper plans churn faster, indicating poor value alignment
