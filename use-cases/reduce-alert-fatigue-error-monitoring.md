# Reduce Alert Fatigue by Tuning Error Monitoring with AI

## The Problem

Your team set up Sentry (or Datadog, or PagerDuty) months ago. At first, every alert felt important. Now the on-call engineer gets 40-60 alerts per shift, and 80% of them are duplicates, known issues, or low-severity noise. Real incidents get buried. The team starts ignoring pages. Last week, a payment processing outage went unnoticed for 23 minutes because the on-call thought it was just another noisy alert.

## The Solution

Use AI to audit your current alert rules, deduplicate error groups, set severity thresholds based on user impact, and create a tiered escalation policy. The `error-monitoring` skill analyzes your error stream and the `alert-optimizer` skill restructures your alert rules.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install error-monitoring alert-optimizer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit your current error landscape

```
Here's our Sentry project export (errors-export.json). Analyze the last 30 days of errors: group them by root cause, show me which ones fire most often, and flag any that are duplicates or already-resolved issues still triggering alerts.
```

The agent processes your error export and returns a breakdown:

```
Error Audit — Last 30 Days (4,812 events total)

Top Error Groups by Volume:
1. TypeError: Cannot read property 'email' of undefined — 1,247 events (26%)
   Source: /api/users/profile.ts:142
   Status: Unresolved, first seen 45 days ago
   Impact: Low — only affects unauthenticated preview requests

2. TimeoutError: Redis connection timed out — 891 events (19%)
   Source: /lib/cache.ts:67
   Status: Known issue, Redis cluster scaling — auto-recovers in <5s
   Impact: Medium — causes ~200ms latency spike, no data loss

3. PaymentProcessingError: Stripe webhook signature invalid — 312 events (6%)
   Source: /api/webhooks/stripe.ts:28
   Status: Unresolved
   Impact: HIGH — failed payments are silently dropped

Duplicate Groups Found: 7 groups that map to the same root cause
Already-Resolved Still Alerting: 3 groups marked "resolved" but re-triggering
```

### 2. Define severity tiers based on user impact

```
Based on that audit, create a three-tier severity model: P1 (page immediately), P2 (Slack notify, respond within 1 hour), P3 (log only, review weekly). Use these criteria: P1 = revenue impact or data loss, P2 = degraded experience for >5% of users, P3 = everything else.
```

### 3. Generate new alert rules

```
Now generate Sentry alert rule configurations (as JSON) for each tier. P1 should page via PagerDuty, P2 should post to #engineering-alerts in Slack, P3 should just be captured with no notification. Merge the 7 duplicate groups.
```

The agent produces ready-to-import Sentry alert configurations with correct thresholds, deduplication rules, and routing.

### 4. Create an on-call runbook

```
For each P1 alert, generate a runbook entry: what the alert means, likely root cause, first three diagnostic steps, and escalation path. Format as markdown I can add to our wiki.
```

### 5. Set up proactive anomaly detection

```
Finally, create alert rules that detect anomalies — not just thresholds. Set up a rule that pages when the error rate for any endpoint exceeds 3 standard deviations above its 7-day rolling average. This way we catch new issues we haven't seen before, not just known error types.
```

The agent generates anomaly detection configurations:

```
Anomaly Detection Rules:

Rule: "Unusual Error Spike"
  Metric: error_count per endpoint per 5-minute window
  Baseline: 7-day rolling average per endpoint
  Trigger: current > (baseline_mean + 3 * baseline_stddev)
  Cooldown: 30 minutes (avoid re-alerting on the same spike)
  Severity: P2 (auto-promotes to P1 if spike persists >15 minutes)

Rule: "New Error Type"
  Trigger: First occurrence of an error fingerprint not seen in the last 30 days
  Severity: P2
  Action: Slack notification with stack trace and affected endpoint

Rule: "Error Rate Ratio"
  Metric: (5xx responses / total responses) per 5-minute window
  Trigger: ratio > 5% (baseline is typically 0.3%)
  Severity: P1 if ratio > 10%, P2 if 5-10%
```

## Real-World Example

Marcus is a backend engineer at a 20-person SaaS startup. His team of four developers rotates on-call weekly. Last month they logged 1,847 alert notifications — roughly 460 per person per week. After running the AI audit, they discovered 62% of alerts were from three known, low-impact issues. They applied the tiered model: 8 error patterns became P1, 15 became P2, and 94 were downgraded to P3.

1. Marcus exports 30 days of Sentry data and feeds it to the agent
2. The agent identifies that Redis timeout errors alone account for 19% of all pages — but they self-heal in seconds
3. New alert rules are generated: Redis timeouts become P3, payment errors become P1
4. The on-call engineer's alert volume drops from 460/week to 35/week, all actionable
5. Mean time to acknowledge real incidents drops from 23 minutes to 4 minutes
