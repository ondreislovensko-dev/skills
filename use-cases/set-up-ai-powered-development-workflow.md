# Accelerate Sprint Velocity with CodeRabbit Reviews and Vercel AI SDK

Nina leads a 6-person engineering team at a B2B SaaS startup. Their sprint cycle is 2 weeks, but features consistently slip to 3. Code reviews take 2-3 days, junior devs spend hours on boilerplate, and 60% of PRs need rework for the same repeated issues.

## The Problem

The team's velocity is crippled by three bottlenecks. First, junior developers write inconsistent code because AI assistants don't know the project's conventions — every generated snippet uses different patterns, naming, and error handling. Second, the two senior engineers spend 8+ hours per week reviewing PRs, mostly flagging the same mechanical issues: missing error handling, no tests, wrong patterns. Third, the product roadmap includes AI features but nobody has built streaming AI UIs before, adding another learning curve.

## The Solution

Embed AI at three points in the development workflow: code writing (Cursor rules for project-aware generation), code review (CodeRabbit for automated PR feedback), and the product itself (Vercel AI SDK for streaming AI features). Install all three skills to get started:

```bash
npx terminal-skills install cursor-ai coderabbit vercel-ai-sdk
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Set Up Project-Level AI Context with Cursor Rules

Create `.cursor/rules` files that encode your project's conventions. Every AI suggestion then follows your actual patterns — junior devs stop writing inconsistent code because the AI already knows the conventions.

```markdown
# .cursor/rules/backend.mdc
---
description: Rules for all backend code in src/server/
globs: ["src/server/**/*.ts"]
---
## Patterns
- Every tRPC procedure must validate input with Zod schemas
- Use TRPCError for errors, never throw raw errors
- All database queries go through repository functions in src/server/db/repos/
- Use createId() from @paralleldrive/cuid2 for IDs, never UUID

## Naming
- Files: kebab-case (user-repository.ts)
- Functions: camelCase, verb-first (getUserById, createSubscription)
- Types: PascalCase with descriptive suffixes (CreateUserInput, UserWithOrg)
```

### 2. Automate PR Review with CodeRabbit

Configure `.coderabbit.yaml` with path-specific instructions matching your architecture. CodeRabbit reviews PRs in 2 minutes instead of 2 days, catching missing error handling, unused imports, and security concerns before a human ever looks at it.

```yaml
# .coderabbit.yaml
tone_instructions: >
  Be direct and specific. Point to the exact line and show the fix.
reviews:
  request_changes_workflow: true
  path_instructions:
    - path: "src/server/**/*.ts"
      instructions: |
        Check for: Zod validation on tRPC procedures, proper TRPCError usage,
        repository layer for DB queries, no sensitive data logged.
    - path: "src/app/**/*.tsx"
      instructions: |
        Check for: server components where possible, loading/error states,
        accessibility (labels, alt text), no hardcoded strings.
```

Senior review time drops from 45 minutes to 10 minutes per PR, focused on architecture and business logic rather than mechanical issues.

### 3. Add AI Features to the Product with Vercel AI SDK

Use `streamObject` for structured AI outputs with type-safe schemas. For example, a natural language task creator that parses "Create a high-priority bug for the login page crashing on Safari, assign to Marco, due Friday" into a structured task:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamObject } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

const taskSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  priority: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high", "urgent"]),
  type: z.enum(["feature", "bug", "chore", "spike"]),
  assignee: z.string().optional(),
  dueDate: z.string().optional(),
});

const result = streamObject({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  schema: taskSchema,
  prompt: `Parse this into a structured task: "${input}"`,
});
```

On the client, use `useObject` from `@ai-sdk/react` to render the structured response as it streams in, giving users instant visual feedback.

## Real-World Example

Nina's team adopts this workflow for a Q1 product push. Marcus, a junior dev, needs to build an org-level billing page. He opens Cursor, which auto-applies the backend and frontend rules. The generated tRPC procedure already uses Zod validation, the repository pattern, and proper error handling. Marcus opens a PR at 2pm. CodeRabbit reviews it in 3 minutes, flagging one missing Suspense boundary and a hardcoded string. Marcus fixes both in 10 minutes. Sarah, the senior engineer, reviews at 3pm — she spends 8 minutes on architecture feedback instead of 45 minutes on mechanical issues. The PR merges by 4pm.

After 6 weeks, the results:

1. PR cycle time dropped from 5.2 days to 1.4 days
2. First-review pass rate improved from 40% to 78%
3. Junior devs report 3x faster feature scaffolding with Cursor rules
4. Sprint velocity increased from 21 to 38 story points
5. ESLint violations per PR dropped from 12 to 2
