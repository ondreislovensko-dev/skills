# Automate Weekly Stakeholder Status Reports with AI

## The Problem

Every Friday afternoon, engineering leads scramble to write status reports for stakeholders. They check Jira for completed tickets, scan Slack for notable discussions, review git logs for shipped features, and try to remember what blockers came up during the week. The result is either a rushed bullet list that's too technical for executives or a polished document that took two hours to write. Multiply this by every team lead, and you're burning 10+ engineering hours per week on reporting.

## The Solution

Use **weekly-report** to structure the status update, **github** to pull merged PRs and release data, and **report-generator** to format a stakeholder-friendly document.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install weekly-report
npx terminal-skills install github
npx terminal-skills install report-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Gather the raw data

Tell the agent what sources to pull from:

```
Generate my weekly status report. Pull data from:
- GitHub: merged PRs in our-org/api and our-org/web repos this week
- This summary of key decisions: moved auth to JWT, postponed mobile launch to March
- Blockers: waiting on legal review for GDPR data export feature
```

### 2. The agent collects and organizes

```
Data collected for week of Feb 10-14, 2026:

GitHub Activity:
- our-org/api: 14 PRs merged, 3 releases (v2.14.1, v2.14.2, v2.15.0)
- our-org/web: 9 PRs merged, 1 release (v3.8.0)

Key PRs:
- #482: Implement batch payment processing (api)
- #489: Add retry logic for webhook delivery (api)
- #156: Redesign settings page with new nav (web)
- #161: Add dark mode support (web)

Categorizing into: Shipped, In Progress, Blocked, Decisions Made...
```

### 3. Review the draft report

```
Weekly Status Report — Engineering
Week of February 10-14, 2026

## Shipped This Week
- Batch payment processing — merchants can now process up to 500 payments in a single API call (v2.15.0)
- Webhook delivery retry logic — failed webhooks now retry 3x with exponential backoff
- Settings page redesign — new navigation structure with improved UX
- Dark mode — available to all users via settings toggle

## In Progress
- GDPR data export feature — code complete, awaiting legal review (BLOCKED)
- Mobile app v2 — timeline shifted to March per team decision

## Key Decisions
- Authentication migrating from session cookies to JWT tokens for API consistency
- Mobile app launch postponed to March to align with marketing campaign

## Metrics
- 23 PRs merged across 2 repos
- 4 releases shipped
- Sprint velocity: 42 points (up from 38 last week)

## Next Week
- Complete JWT migration (estimated 3 days)
- Begin QA cycle for data export feature once legal approves
- Start sprint planning for mobile v2
```

### 4. Adjust the tone for different audiences

```
Create an executive version — shorter, no technical details, focused on business impact and timelines.
```

The agent reformats the report emphasizing business outcomes, timelines, and risk items rather than technical specifics.

## Real-World Example

Priya is the VP of Engineering at a 40-person startup with three engineering squads. Each lead writes a weekly report, and Priya synthesizes them into one executive update. Using the automated reporting workflow:

1. Each squad lead spends 5 minutes telling the agent their highlights, blockers, and decisions
2. The agent pulls GitHub data for each squad's repos and generates individual team reports
3. Priya asks the agent to combine all three reports into an executive summary with a risks section
4. The agent produces a one-page executive brief highlighting shipped features, at-risk timelines, and resource needs
5. What used to take 3 hours across the team now takes 15 minutes total, and the reports are more consistent and data-backed

### Report Customization Tips

Different stakeholders need different views:

- **CEO/Board** — business impact only: features shipped, revenue-affecting items, strategic risks
- **Product Manager** — feature progress, user-facing changes, upcoming milestones
- **Engineering Peers** — technical details, architecture decisions, tech debt progress
- **External Stakeholders** — sanitized version without internal metrics or sensitive details

The agent can maintain templates for each audience and generate all versions from the same source data in one pass.

### Data Sources the Agent Can Pull From

Beyond GitHub, the agent can integrate data from:

- **Jira/Linear** — completed tickets, sprint progress, velocity trends
- **Slack** — key decisions from channels (summarized, not raw messages)
- **Datadog/Grafana** — uptime, error rates, performance metrics for the week
- **Google Calendar** — upcoming milestones and deadlines
