# Build a Video-to-Text Content Pipeline

## The Problem

A developer advocate records 3-4 conference talks and tutorial videos per month. Each 45-minute video contains material that could become a blog post, a Twitter thread, show notes for the company knowledge base, and timestamped chapter markers for YouTube. Manually transcribing and repurposing a single video takes 4-6 hours: watching at 1.5x speed while taking notes, structuring those notes into a blog post, pulling key quotes for social media, and creating chapter markers by scrubbing through the timeline. With 15 videos backlogged, the content never gets repurposed, and valuable technical insights stay locked in video format where they cannot be searched, skimmed, or indexed by search engines.

## The Solution

Use **yt-dlp** to download videos and extract audio from YouTube and other platforms, **youtube-transcription** to pull existing platform subtitles when available, and **whisper** for high-accuracy local transcription when subtitles do not exist or are auto-generated garbage. The pipeline produces raw transcripts that feed into blog posts, show notes, and social content.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Download and organize video content

Pull videos from YouTube, conference sites, and local recordings into a consistent format with metadata preserved. Yt-dlp supports hundreds of video platforms, so conference talks hosted on Vimeo, custom event sites, or private platforms all work the same way.

> Download these 4 YouTube videos from our conference talk playlist using yt-dlp. Extract the audio as WAV files for transcription, and also download the best quality video files. Save each with the format YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug. Preserve the video metadata (title, description, duration, upload date) in a JSON sidecar file for each download.

The metadata sidecar is important for the later content generation steps: the original video title, description, and upload date provide context that improves the quality of the generated blog posts and social media content.

### 2. Extract or generate transcriptions

Check for existing human-made subtitles first, then fall back to Whisper for videos without quality captions. The order matters because human subtitles are faster to retrieve and often more accurate for domain-specific terminology.

> For each of the 4 videos, first check if YouTube has manually-uploaded English subtitles using youtube-transcription. If manual subtitles exist, pull those -- they are higher quality than auto-generated ones. For the two conference talks that only have auto-generated captions (or no captions at all), run Whisper locally using the large-v3 model to produce accurate transcripts. Output all transcripts in both SRT format (with timestamps) and plain text format.

Whisper's large-v3 model handles technical vocabulary (Kubernetes, gRPC, WebSocket) far better than YouTube's auto-generated captions, which frequently mangle technical terms into nonsense.

### 3. Generate timestamped chapter markers

Analyze the transcript to identify topic transitions and produce YouTube chapter markers with descriptions. Chapter markers dramatically improve the viewing experience because most viewers come to a technical talk looking for a specific topic, not to watch the entire presentation.

> Analyze the transcript for the 47-minute KubeCon talk and generate YouTube chapter markers. Identify major topic shifts based on content changes (introduction, problem statement, demo sections, architecture explanation, Q&A). Format the output as YouTube-compatible timestamps starting with 0:00 for the intro. Each chapter should have a concise 5-8 word title. Also generate an extended description with one-sentence summaries per chapter.

### 4. Transform transcripts into blog posts

Convert the raw transcript into a structured, readable blog post that captures the key technical content. The transcript provides the raw material, but it needs restructuring because spoken presentations follow a different logic than written articles.

> Transform the transcript from the "Building Resilient Microservices" talk into a technical blog post. Remove filler words, verbal tics, and audience interaction. Restructure the content into logical sections with headers. Keep the technical depth and specific examples from the talk but rewrite the conversational tone into clear written prose. Add code blocks for any code that was shown during the demo sections. Target 1,500-2,000 words.

### 5. Create social media content from key moments

Pull quotable insights and create platform-specific content pieces from the best moments in each talk. The timestamps from the transcripts make it possible to link each social media post directly to the relevant moment in the video.

> From the 4 transcribed talks, extract the 10 most quotable technical insights -- statements that are specific, actionable, and opinionated rather than generic. Format each as a standalone tweet with context. Also create a Twitter thread summarizing the KubeCon talk in 8-10 tweets, with timestamps linking to the specific moment in the YouTube video for each point.

Each linked timestamp gives the social media post a built-in call to action: readers who find the insight interesting can click through to hear the full context without watching the entire 45-minute talk.

## Real-World Example

A developer relations team at an infrastructure startup had 18 months of conference talks, webinars, and tutorial recordings on their YouTube channel with zero written companion content. They ran the pipeline on a batch of 12 videos over a weekend. Yt-dlp pulled all videos and audio in under an hour, including two talks from a conference site that was not YouTube.

Three videos had quality manual subtitles that youtube-transcription extracted instantly. The remaining nine went through Whisper's large-v3 model on a machine with an RTX 4090, processing at roughly 10x real-time -- a 45-minute talk transcribed in about 4.5 minutes. Whisper handled the technical content well: "Kubernetes" appeared correctly in every instance, whereas the YouTube auto-captions had rendered it as "Cooper Nettie's" in three separate talks.

The transcripts fed into 12 blog posts published over the next six weeks, driving 34% more organic search traffic to the company site because search engines could now index the technical content that was previously locked inside video. The YouTube chapter markers alone increased average watch duration by 22% because viewers could jump to the sections relevant to their problem instead of scrubbing through a 45-minute timeline.
