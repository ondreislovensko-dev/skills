# Build an SEO Content Engine for Your SaaS

## The Problem

Your SaaS gets 200 organic visitors/month. Your top competitor gets 15,000. Their blog has 140 articles covering every angle of the problem you solve. You have 3 posts: a launch announcement, a feature update nobody read, and a "why we built this" founder story.

Content marketing is the most cost-effective SaaS growth channel, but it requires volume and strategy. Quality freelancers cost $300-500/article, and you need 30+ for topical authority — $9,000-15,000 before ranking for a single keyword. SEO agencies charge $3,000-8,000/month with no guaranteed results for 3-6 months.

Worst of all, without keyword research and competitor gap analysis, you could write 30 articles on topics nobody searches for. You don't have an SEO specialist, a content strategist, or a writer. The gap widens every month your competitors publish and you don't.

## The Solution

Combine **seo-audit** for technical SEO and gap analysis, **content-strategy** for keyword research and planning, and **web-research** for deep topic research. This workflow finds where competitors rank and you don't, builds a prioritized calendar targeting achievable keywords, and produces optimized outlines with the depth to outrank existing content.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install seo-audit content-strategy web-research
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit your SEO position vs competitors

```
Compare our SEO against our top 3 competitors. Show the keyword gap.
```

```
YOUR SITE: DR 18, 34 keywords, ~210 visitors/mo, 3 blog posts
  competitor1.com — DR 52, 847 keywords, ~15,200 visitors/mo, 142 posts
  competitor2.com — DR 41, 523 keywords, ~8,400 visitors/mo, 89 posts
  competitor3.com — DR 35, 312 keywords, ~4,100 visitors/mo, 67 posts

KEYWORD GAP (they rank, you don't):
  High opportunity (low KD, decent volume):
    "product analytics for startups"      — 720/mo, KD 22
    "how to track feature adoption"       — 480/mo, KD 18
    "cohort analysis tutorial"            — 390/mo, KD 15
    "user retention analysis guide"       — 520/mo, KD 24

  247 total gap keywords | Top 10 potential: 2,400-3,200 visitors/mo
```

### 2. Build a 90-day content calendar

```
Create a content calendar targeting keyword gaps. Organize as topic clusters.
```

```
90-Day Calendar — 24 articles, 2/week

PILLAR 1: Product Analytics Fundamentals (7 articles)
  Week 1: "Product Analytics for Startups: Complete Guide" (pillar, 720/mo KD 22)
  Week 2: "How to Track Feature Adoption Step-by-Step" (480/mo KD 18)
  Week 3: "Cohort Analysis Tutorial: Find Why Users Leave" (390/mo KD 15)
  Week 4: "8 Product Metrics Every PM Should Track" (620/mo KD 26)
  ... (3 more)

PILLAR 2: Retention & Churn (8 articles, weeks 3-8)
PILLAR 3: Implementation & Technical (9 articles, weeks 5-12)

Internal linking: each article → pillar + 2 siblings
Projected traffic at 90 days: 2,400-3,200 organic visitors/month
```

### 3. Research and outline the pillar article

```
Research "product analytics for startups." Analyze top 5 ranking articles, find gaps, create a better outline.
```

```
TOP 5 RANKING: 1,890-3,201 words, mostly high-level overviews

GAPS (none of the top 5 cover):
  ✗ Budget-constrained tool selection for seed/Series A
  ✗ Week-by-week implementation timeline
  ✗ Open-source alternatives (PostHog, Plausible)
  ✗ Dashboard templates or screenshots

OUTLINE: 3,500-4,000 words, 7 sections
  H2: Why Startups Need Product Analytics (400 words)
  H2: 5 Metrics That Matter Pre-Series A (500 words)
  H2: Choosing Your Stack on a Startup Budget (600 words — decision matrix)
  H2: Week-by-Week Implementation Guide (800 words)
  H2: Common Mistakes (400 words)
  H2: From Data to Decisions: A Framework (500 words)
  + Internal links to 3 cluster articles

SEO: primary keyword in H1, intro, 2 H2s, conclusion. LSI keywords mapped.
```

### 4. Generate article drafts

```
Write the first 3 articles: analytics pillar, feature adoption guide, cohort tutorial.
```

```
Article 1: "Product Analytics for Startups: Complete 2026 Guide"
  3,742 words | 16 min read | 7 H2s, 14 H3s | 4 internal links ✓

Article 2: "How to Track Feature Adoption (Step-by-Step)"
  2,891 words | 12 min read | Code snippets (JS, Python, Ruby) ✓

Article 3: "Cohort Analysis Tutorial: Find Why Users Leave"
  3,104 words | 13 min read | Example data tables + walkthrough ✓

Total: 9,737 words | Time saved vs manual writing: 18-24 hours
Ready for review — add brand voice and product screenshots before publishing.
```

### 5. Set up monthly SEO monitoring

```
Create a tracking system to measure what's working and adjust strategy.
```

```
Monthly metrics: organic traffic, keywords in top 10/3, CTR by article
Keyword tracking: 24 target keywords with position goals by month
  Month 1: 210 → 450 visitors (content indexed)
  Month 2: 450 → 1,200 (rankings climbing)
  Month 3: 1,200 → 2,800 (topical authority established)

Monthly review: First Monday — what ranked, what declined, what to update
```

## Real-World Example

The co-founder of a bootstrapped analytics SaaS had tried content marketing twice and quit both times. First attempt: 5 posts targeting high-difficulty keywords — none ranked. Second: 8 generic freelance articles from someone who'd never used analytics software. Twelve months and $4,200 later, organic traffic was still 180/month.

She ran the three-skill workflow on a Friday. The competitive analysis revealed something surprising: both main competitors had zero implementation-focused content. All their articles were thought leadership. Keywords like "how to set up event tracking for SaaS" (380/mo, KD 14) were wide open.

She built a 90-day calendar targeting 24 implementation guides — the practical content competitors hadn't written. Over 6 weeks, she published 12 articles, spending ~2 hours each on review and adding product screenshots. By week 8, the cohort analysis tutorial ranked #4. By week 12: 2,840 organic visitors/month, up from 180. Three visitors converted to paying customers in month 3 — $2,700 new MRR from content that cost essentially nothing to produce.
