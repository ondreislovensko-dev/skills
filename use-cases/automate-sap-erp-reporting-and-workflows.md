# Automate SAP ERP Reporting and Workflows

## The Problem

A mid-size manufacturing company with 400 employees runs SAP S/4HANA for procurement, inventory, and finance. The operations team manually creates purchase orders when stock dips below threshold, which means someone checks inventory levels in SAP every morning and copies numbers into a spreadsheet to decide what to reorder.

Month-end financial closing takes 5 days because the controller manually exports data from 6 different SAP modules and reconciles them in Excel. Material master data has 1,200 records with inconsistent units of measure and missing cost centers, causing procurement errors weekly. Last quarter, a production line stopped for 4 hours because a reorder was missed over a holiday weekend when nobody checked stock levels.

## The Solution

Use the **sap** skill to automate repetitive SAP workflows: generate purchase orders from inventory thresholds, validate and clean material master data, run financial period-end reports, and set up alerts for procurement bottlenecks.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Automate inventory-based purchase order creation

Query SAP stock levels and generate POs for materials below reorder thresholds:

> Query SAP S/4HANA API endpoint /API_MATERIAL_STOCK_SRV for all materials in plant 1010. Compare current stock against the reorder point in the material master (MRP view). For each material where available quantity is below the reorder point, create a purchase order via /API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV with the preferred vendor from the source list, standard order quantity from the material master, and delivery date set to today plus the vendor's planned delivery time. Log each created PO with material number, quantity, vendor, and expected delivery date.

The automation should run daily at 6 AM before the operations team arrives. Include a safety check that prevents duplicate POs: if an open PO already exists for the same material and vendor, skip creation and log the existing PO number.

### 2. Validate and clean material master data

Scan all material master records for inconsistencies and missing required fields:

> Pull all active material master records from /API_PRODUCT_SRV for plant 1010. Check each record for: missing cost center assignment, inconsistent base unit of measure (flag materials using "EA" in one view and "PC" in another), missing MRP type, blank safety stock where reorder point is set, and missing vendor assignment in the purchasing view. Generate a report grouped by issue type with material number, description, and the specific field that needs correction. For the 47 materials with inconsistent units of measure, suggest the correct unit based on the material group standard.

Material master data quality degrades gradually as different people create records over years. Running validation monthly catches problems before they cause procurement errors or reporting inaccuracies.

### 3. Generate month-end financial closing report

Pull data from multiple SAP modules and produce a consolidated financial summary:

> Run the month-end closing report for January 2026. Pull accounts payable aging from /API_SUPPLIERINVOICE_PROCESS_SRV, accounts receivable from /API_BILLING_DOCUMENT_SRV, general ledger trial balance from /API_JOURNALENTRYITEMBASIC_SRV filtered to company code 1000 and fiscal period 001/2026, and inventory valuation from /API_MATERIAL_STOCK_SRV. Consolidate into a summary showing total AP ($2.3M expected), total AR, inventory value by plant, and GL balance by cost center. Flag any journal entries posted after the soft close date of January 28th that need controller review.

The report should highlight discrepancies between modules. If the GL shows a different inventory value than the material valuation report, that indicates a posting error that needs investigation before the books close.

### 4. Monitor procurement bottlenecks

Identify overdue purchase orders and vendor performance issues:

> Query all open purchase orders from /API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV where the confirmed delivery date has passed. Group by vendor and calculate: number of overdue POs, average days overdue, and total value of delayed materials. For vendors with more than 3 overdue POs or any PO overdue by more than 14 days, generate an escalation summary with vendor name, contact info from the vendor master, and the list of affected materials. Flag any overdue POs that are blocking production orders.

Vendor performance tracking over time creates leverage for renegotiating contracts. A vendor who consistently delivers 5 days late can be confronted with data showing 6 months of delays and their downstream impact on production schedules.

### 5. Create a weekly operations dashboard

Produce a summary that the plant manager reviews every Monday morning:

> Generate the weekly operations summary for plant 1010. Include: purchase orders created this week with total value, materials received vs expected, inventory turns by material group, top 10 materials by consumption rate, stockout incidents (materials that hit zero available stock), and open quality notifications from /API_QUALITYNOTIFICATION_SRV. Compare current week inventory levels against the 4-week moving average and highlight materials with consumption trending up more than 20%.

The dashboard replaces a Monday morning meeting where three managers each presented their numbers from separate SAP transactions. A single consolidated view saves an hour of meeting time and ensures everyone works from the same data.

## Real-World Example

On Monday morning, the automated inventory check finds 23 materials below their reorder points at plant 1010. Purchase orders are generated for all 23 within minutes, totaling EUR 147,000 across 6 vendors. The operations manager reviews the PO log over coffee instead of spending 90 minutes manually checking stock levels in SAP transaction MD04. The material master validation catches that 47 records have mismatched units of measure between the MRP and purchasing views, explaining why the team kept getting wrong quantities on deliveries for those items.

Month-end closing, which previously took the controller 5 full days of exporting and reconciling, now produces a draft report in under an hour, leaving 4 days for analysis instead of data wrangling. The procurement bottleneck report identifies one vendor with 7 overdue POs averaging 11 days late, providing the purchasing department with evidence to trigger the penalty clause in their supply agreement.
