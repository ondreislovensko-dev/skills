# Create Automated Client Project Proposals from Requirements with AI

## The Problem

A 12-person digital agency sends out 8 to 10 project proposals per month. Each proposal takes a senior developer 4 to 6 hours to write — scoping the work, estimating timelines, structuring deliverables, and formatting the document. Half the proposals never convert, which means 20 to 30 hours per month spent on documents that lead nowhere. The proposals also vary wildly in quality depending on who writes them — some are detailed and persuasive, others are bare-bones bullet lists that undersell the team's capabilities.

The worst part is the turnaround time. A hot lead calls on Tuesday, the proposal doesn't go out until Thursday, and by Friday they've signed with a competitor who responded in 24 hours. The agency's win rate on proposals sent within 24 hours is 3x higher than proposals sent after 48 hours, but achieving that turnaround with manual writing is nearly impossible when the senior team is already billing 35+ hours a week on active projects.

## The Solution

Using the **proposal-writer**, **markdown-writer**, and **data-analysis** skills, rough discovery call notes turn into a structured, data-backed proposal in under an hour. Historical project data calibrates the estimates so quotes reflect what actually happens on past projects rather than optimistic guesses.

The difference from writing proposals manually isn't just speed. Every proposal gets the same analytical rigor: scope decomposition, risk identification, historical calibration, and budget variants. No more proposals that vary wildly depending on who wrote them or how rushed they were.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

The workflow takes a proposal from raw call notes to a polished, multi-tier document in five steps. Each step builds on the previous one, so the final proposal isn't just formatted notes — it's a data-backed sales document calibrated against the agency's actual project history.

### Step 1: Feed in the Raw Requirements

After a discovery call, dump the raw notes — no formatting needed, just everything that was discussed:

```text
Create a project proposal from these requirements: Client is a 50-person logistics company. They need a driver dispatch dashboard — real-time map view, route optimization, driver availability status, and integration with their existing Oracle ERP. They want a web app and a mobile companion app. Budget range mentioned: $80K-$120K. Timeline: launch in 4 months.
```

The messier the notes, the more valuable the structuring step becomes. Most agencies lose information between the call and the proposal because nobody writes down the implicit requirements — the things the client assumes are included but never explicitly said. "Integration with Oracle ERP" sounds like one line item, but it could mean anything from "read-only API calls" to "bidirectional real-time sync with custom middleware." Surfacing that ambiguity now, in the proposal, prevents a $30K surprise at month 3.

### Step 2: Structure the Scope

The raw notes get broken down into phased deliverables with clear boundaries:

**Proposal Draft — Driver Dispatch Dashboard**

| Phase | Deliverables | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Web dashboard with real-time map and driver status | 8 weeks |
| Phase 2 | Route optimization engine and Oracle ERP integration | 4 weeks |
| Phase 3 | Mobile companion app (iOS + Android) | 4 weeks |

But the real value is in what comes after the table. The scope document identifies **14 specific deliverables** with acceptance criteria for each one. "Real-time map view" becomes "Interactive map displaying driver locations updated every 10 seconds, with status indicators (available, en route, on break) and 30-minute position history trails."

It also surfaces **6 assumptions** — things like "Oracle ERP has a documented REST API" and "Client provides staging ERP credentials by week 3." If any of these assumptions turn out to be wrong, they're covered in the change request process instead of becoming uncompensated scope creep.

The **4 explicit exclusions** are equally important: "ERP data migration," "driver hardware procurement," "offline mobile functionality," and "multi-language support." These prevent the conversation three months into the project where the client says "I assumed that was included."

### Step 3: Calibrate Against Historical Data

This is where proposals stop being fiction. Instead of guessing, the estimates draw from the agency's actual track record:

```text
Compare this scope against our last 12 completed projects. What's a realistic timeline and budget based on similar work? Adjust estimates if our actual delivery times exceeded initial estimates.
```

The historical analysis reveals uncomfortable truths:

- Similar dashboard projects averaged **18% over initial timeline estimates**
- Oracle integrations averaged **25% over estimate** (API documentation quality varies wildly between Oracle versions, and the client's IT team response time is unpredictable)
- Mobile companion apps with API dependencies came in on time 80% of the time, but only when the API was stable before mobile development started
- Adjusted recommendation: quote **18 weeks instead of 16**, price at **$105K**

The risk factors get specific enough to act on. Oracle ERP integration carries the highest uncertainty — the recommendation is a 2-week paid discovery phase before committing to a fixed timeline. Mobile app scope needs explicit feature parity levels with the web app to prevent "but I assumed it would do everything the web does" conversations later.

The $105K price isn't pulled from thin air. It's the median of what similar projects actually cost after all the overruns, rounded to a clean number. The client gets an honest price, and the agency doesn't eat margin on predictable problems.

This calibration step is what separates a good proposal from a wishful one. Most agencies quote based on what they think the project should cost, then absorb the overrun or negotiate scope cuts mid-project. Calibrating against reality means the quote accounts for the things that always go wrong — because they always do.

### Step 4: Generate the Polished Proposal

```text
Generate the full proposal document with: executive summary, scope breakdown with deliverables per phase, timeline with milestones, pricing table, team composition, assumptions, and terms. Use a professional but approachable tone. Export as both markdown and PDF.
```

The finished document runs 6 pages — long enough to be comprehensive, short enough that the decision-maker actually reads it:

1. **Executive Summary** — business value and approach overview, written for the CEO who won't read past page 1. Leads with the client's problem (driver coordination costs them 12 hours/week of dispatcher time), not the agency's solution.
2. **Scope of Work** — 14 deliverables across 3 phases, each with specific acceptance criteria so "done" is never ambiguous
3. **Technical Approach** — architecture diagram, technology stack (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Mapbox), integration points with Oracle ERP
4. **Timeline** — 18-week Gantt chart with milestones and client review gates at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. Review gates are mandatory — they prevent the "we didn't expect it to look like that" reveal at week 18.
5. **Pricing** — $105,000 total broken down by phase ($42K Phase 1, $35K Phase 2, $28K Phase 3) with payment tied to milestone completion
6. **Team & Terms** — team composition (lead developer, 2 engineers, UX designer, project manager), payment schedule, change request process, IP ownership

Both `proposals/dispatch-dashboard-proposal.md` and `proposals/dispatch-dashboard-proposal.pdf` are ready to send.

The difference between this and a manually written proposal isn't just speed — it's consistency. Every proposal the agency sends now has the same structure, the same level of detail, and the same quality of risk analysis. The intern who just joined gets the same proposal quality as the principal who's been there for 8 years.

### Step 5: Create Budget Variants

Clients almost always push back on price. Having pre-built alternatives prevents a week of back-and-forth and shows the agency thought about the client's constraints:

```text
The client might push back on price. Create a "lite" version that hits $80K by reducing scope — suggest what to cut with least impact on the core value proposition. Also create a "premium" version that adds high-value features.
```

Three tiers emerge:

| Tier | Price | What Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Lite** | $78K | Defers mobile app to future phase, simplifies route optimization to basic suggestions |
| **Standard** | $105K | Full scope as proposed — web + mobile + optimization + ERP integration |
| **Premium** | $130K | Adds driver-facing mobile app with offline mode, advanced analytics dashboard, and SMS alerts |

The lite version preserves the core dispatch dashboard — the feature the client actually called about. The premium version adds features the client didn't ask for but will probably want once they see the base product in action.

The lite version cuts intelligently — it defers the mobile app (which is a separate product with its own complexity) rather than cutting corners on the core dashboard. The premium version plants a seed: the client might not want analytics and SMS alerts now, but seeing them in the proposal makes them think about future phases. Even if they pick lite today, the premium tier becomes the Phase 2 conversation.

Three tiers give the client a sense of control and anchor the middle option as the obvious choice. The agency's close rate on three-tier proposals is 40% higher than single-price proposals because the conversation shifts from "yes or no" to "which one."

## Real-World Example

Nina, a project manager at the agency, has a discovery call at 2 PM and the client wants a proposal by end of week. In the old workflow, she'd block out Thursday morning for writing — if she even had Thursday morning free. Last month she lost a $90K deal because the proposal went out 5 days after the call and the client had already signed with a faster competitor.

Instead, she feeds her call notes in right after the call. The scope gets structured into 3 phases with 14 specific deliverables, assumptions, and exclusions. Historical data adjusts the timeline from 16 to 18 weeks and recommends pricing at $105K to account for Oracle integration risk. Nina reviews the generated proposal, tweaks two deliverable descriptions to match language the client used on the call, and adds a personal note to the executive summary.

The complete proposal — three pricing tiers, milestone timeline, and acceptance criteria — goes out at 5 PM the same day, 3 hours after the call instead of 3 days. The client signs the following week, citing the detailed scope breakdown as the reason they chose the agency over two competitors who submitted generic proposals. More importantly, the 18-week timeline holds because the estimates were calibrated against reality. The project delivers on week 17, and nobody has to explain why it's running late.

## Tips for Better Proposals

- **Always adjust for historical overruns** — if your past projects consistently run 20% over estimate, bake that into the quote rather than hoping this time will be different
- **Include a "what's not included" section** — prevents scope creep and sets clear expectations from day one
- **Offer two or three pricing tiers** — gives the client a sense of control and increases close rates by shifting the conversation from "should we?" to "which one?"
- **Send within 24 hours of the discovery call** — speed signals professionalism and keeps momentum while the client still remembers the conversation
- **Tie payments to milestones** — protects both sides and creates natural checkpoints for scope validation
