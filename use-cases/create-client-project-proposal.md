# Create Automated Client Project Proposals from Requirements with AI

## The Problem

A 12-person digital agency sends out 8 to 10 project proposals per month. Each proposal takes a senior developer 4 to 6 hours to write — scoping the work, estimating timelines, structuring deliverables, and formatting the document. Half the proposals never convert, which means 20 to 30 hours per month spent on documents that lead nowhere. The proposals also vary wildly in quality depending on who writes them — some are detailed and persuasive, others are bare-bones bullet lists that undersell the team's capabilities.

## The Solution

Use the **proposal-writer** skill to generate structured proposals from rough requirements, the **markdown-writer** skill to format them professionally, and the **data-analysis** skill to estimate timelines based on historical project data.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install proposal-writer markdown-writer data-analysis
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Feed in the raw requirements

After a discovery call, give the agent your notes:

```
Create a project proposal from these requirements: Client is a 50-person logistics company. They need a driver dispatch dashboard — real-time map view, route optimization, driver availability status, and integration with their existing Oracle ERP. They want a web app and a mobile companion app. Budget range mentioned: $80K-$120K. Timeline: launch in 4 months.
```

### 2. The agent structures the scope

```
Proposal Draft — Driver Dispatch Dashboard

Scope Summary:
- Phase 1: Web dashboard with real-time map and driver status (8 weeks)
- Phase 2: Route optimization engine and Oracle ERP integration (4 weeks)
- Phase 3: Mobile companion app (iOS + Android) (4 weeks)

Deliverables: 14 items identified
Assumptions: 6 listed
Out of scope: 4 items clarified
```

### 3. Estimate based on historical data

```
Compare this scope against our last 12 completed projects. What's a realistic timeline and budget based on similar work? Adjust estimates if our actual delivery times exceeded initial estimates.
```

```
Historical Comparison:
- Similar dashboard projects averaged 18% over initial timeline estimates
- Oracle integrations averaged 25% over estimate (API documentation quality varies)
- Adjusted recommendation: quote 18 weeks instead of 16, price at $105K

Risk factors:
- Oracle ERP integration is the highest uncertainty — suggest a discovery phase
- Mobile app scope should specify feature parity level with web
```

### 4. Generate the polished proposal

```
Generate the full proposal document with: executive summary, scope breakdown with deliverables per phase, timeline with milestones, pricing table, team composition, assumptions, and terms. Use a professional but approachable tone. Export as both markdown and PDF.
```

### 5. The agent produces a complete proposal

```
Generated: Driver Dispatch Dashboard — Project Proposal

Document structure (6 pages):
1. Executive Summary — business value and approach overview
2. Scope of Work — 14 deliverables across 3 phases with acceptance criteria
3. Technical Approach — architecture diagram, technology stack, integration points
4. Timeline — 18-week Gantt chart with milestones and client review gates
5. Pricing — $105,000 total ($42K Phase 1, $35K Phase 2, $28K Phase 3)
6. Team & Terms — team composition, payment schedule, change request process

Files exported:
- proposals/dispatch-dashboard-proposal.md
- proposals/dispatch-dashboard-proposal.pdf
```

### 6. Create proposal variants for different budgets

```
The client might push back on price. Create a "lite" version that hits $80K by reducing scope — suggest what to cut with least impact on the core value proposition.
```

The agent generates an alternative scope that defers the mobile app to a future phase and simplifies route optimization to basic suggestions rather than full optimization, bringing the price to $78K while preserving the core dispatch dashboard value.

## Real-World Example

Nina, a project manager at a 12-person digital agency, has a discovery call at 2 PM and the client wants a proposal by end of week.

1. Nina feeds her call notes into the agent — rough requirements for a driver dispatch dashboard with ERP integration
2. The agent structures the scope into 3 phases with 14 specific deliverables, assumptions, and exclusions
3. Based on the agency's historical data, the agent adjusts the timeline from 16 to 18 weeks and recommends pricing at $105K to account for Oracle integration risk
4. Nina reviews the generated proposal, tweaks two deliverable descriptions, and adds a personal note to the executive summary
5. The complete proposal goes out 3 hours after the call instead of 3 days — the client signs the following week, citing the detailed scope breakdown as the reason they chose the agency over two competitors

## Tips for Better Proposals

- **Always adjust for historical overruns** — if your past projects consistently run 20% over estimate, bake that into the quote
- **Include a "what's not included" section** — prevents scope creep and sets clear expectations
- **Offer two or three pricing tiers** — gives the client a sense of control and increases close rates
- **Send within 24 hours of the discovery call** — speed signals professionalism and keeps momentum
