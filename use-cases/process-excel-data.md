# Transform Messy Spreadsheets Into Business Intelligence and Save 20 Hours Weekly

## The Problem

Every Monday, Ana at a 67-person manufacturing company faces the same nightmare: 23 Excel files from different departments, each with inconsistent formatting, merged cells, and data quality issues. Sales uses mm/dd/yyyy dates, Operations uses dd-mm-yyyy, Finance embeds subtotals randomly throughout data tables. She needs to combine all this into a unified executive dashboard.

The manual process is soul-crushing: 20 hours weekly copying, pasting, cleaning, and cross-referencing data. Product codes like "SKU-001" in one sheet become "SKU_001" in another and "SKU 001" in a third. Customer names have spelling variations: "ACME Corp", "Acme Corporation", "ACME Corp.". Phone numbers range from "(555) 123-4567" to "555.123.4567" to "5551234567". Duplicate detection is manual and error-prone.

The business cost is devastating: 20 hours × 52 weeks × $45/hour = $46,800 annually in pure data processing labor. More critical: the 3-day delay between data collection and executive reporting means leadership makes strategic decisions on stale information. Last quarter, they missed a 15% uptick in returns because the data was 4 days old when analyzed.

## The Solution

Combine **excel-processor** for data transformation, **data-analysis** for pattern recognition, and **report-generator** for automated reporting. The approach: intelligently clean and normalize data, detect duplicates and outliers, generate insights automatically, and create self-updating dashboards.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install excel-processor data-analysis report-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Multi-file data ingestion and standardization

```
Process all 23 department Excel files. Detect data types, normalize formats, and combine into a unified dataset.
```

```
EXCEL FILES PROCESSING COMPLETE:

Data Sources Analyzed:
  Sales_Q4_2024.xlsx (3,247 rows) → Product sales, customer info, dates inconsistent
  Operations_Weekly.xlsx (1,891 rows) → Inventory, SKUs, multiple format variations
  Finance_Reconciliation.xlsx (892 rows) → Revenue, costs, embedded calculations
  HR_Headcount.xlsx (156 rows) → Employee data, departments, salary bands
  ... (19 more files processed)

Format Issues Detected & Fixed:
  📅 Date formats: 7 different patterns → standardized to YYYY-MM-DD
  📞 Phone numbers: 12 format variations → normalized to (XXX) XXX-XXXX  
  💰 Currency: Mixed $1,234.56 and 1234.56 → consistent $X,XXX.XX
  🏷️ Product codes: 23 naming variations → unified SKU-XXXXX format
  🏢 Company names: 89 spelling variations → deduplicated to 34 unique entities

COMBINED DATASET: 47,832 rows × 31 columns, 99.7% data integrity
```

### 2. Advanced duplicate detection and cleaning

```
Identify duplicate records across files using fuzzy matching and business logic rules. Clean inconsistent data entries.
```

```
DUPLICATE DETECTION RESULTS:

Customer Matching (Fuzzy Logic):
  "ACME Corp" = "Acme Corporation" = "ACME Corp." → Merged to canonical name
  "Smith, John" vs "John Smith" vs "J. Smith" → Matched via phone/email
  Address variations: "123 Main St" vs "123 Main Street" → Standardized
  
Product Deduplication:
  SKU variations: SKU-001, SKU_001, SKU 001 → Consolidated to SKU-001
  Description cleanup: "Widget (Red)" vs "Red Widget" → Normalized format
  Price discrepancies: Same SKU with different prices → Flagged for review

CLEANING SUMMARY:
  ✓ 2,847 duplicate customer records merged (retained most recent data)
  ✓ 834 product variations consolidated  
  ✓ 156 address standardizations applied
  ✓ 23 pricing inconsistencies flagged for manual review
  ✓ 4,891 phone number format fixes
  
Final dataset: 44,985 unique records (6% duplicate removal rate)
```

### 3. Automated data quality analysis

```
Analyze data quality issues, detect outliers, and generate data health reports with recommendations.
```

```
DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:

Completeness Analysis:
  Customer Email: 89.4% populated (4,782 missing) → Recommend email append service
  Product Cost: 94.2% populated (2,601 missing) → Inherit from category averages  
  Sales Date: 100% populated ✓
  Region: 78.3% populated (9,847 missing) → Geo-lookup via ZIP codes

Outlier Detection:
  🚨 Order Values: 23 orders >$50k (investigation needed)
  🚨 Inventory: 12 products with negative stock (data error)
  🚨 Margins: 156 products with >90% margin (pricing review required)
  🚨 Customer Orders: 4 customers with >100 orders/day (bot activity?)

Statistical Validation:
  📊 Revenue distribution: Normal (μ=$2,340, σ=$1,890)
  📊 Order frequency: Seasonal pattern detected (Dec peak)
  📊 Customer lifetime value: Power law distribution (80/20 rule confirmed)
  📊 Geographic spread: 47 states represented, concentration in TX/CA/NY

RECOMMENDATIONS: 12 data quality improvements prioritized by business impact
```

## Real-World Example

The operations director at a mid-size logistics company was drowning in Excel files. 34 different sources: driver logs, fuel tracking, maintenance records, customer delivery data, warehouse inventories. Every month-end required 3 full days to manually consolidate everything into executive reports. Data inconsistencies led to wrong inventory decisions, costing $180,000 in expedited shipping fees.

Monday: excel-processor analyzed all data sources. Found 847 different ways their system coded "delivery status." Customer addresses had 23 different formatting patterns. Driver IDs weren't consistent across systems. Total chaos, but patterns were detectable.

Tuesday: Implemented automated data cleaning pipeline. Fuzzy matching connected customer records across systems. Address standardization linked delivery data to billing data. Product code normalization revealed hidden inventory patterns.

Wednesday: data-analysis discovered that 67% of expedited shipments happened because of inventory miscounts — not actual stock-outs. Late deliveries correlated strongly with specific driver routes, not driver performance. Fuel costs varied 34% between depots for identical routes due to contract differences.

Results: Month-end reporting dropped from 3 days to 4 hours. More importantly, the insights were actionable. Route optimization based on data analysis saved $67,000 in fuel costs. Inventory accuracy improvements eliminated 89% of expedited shipping fees. ROI: $340,000 annually from what started as "just cleaning up spreadsheets."
