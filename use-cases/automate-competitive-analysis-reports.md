# Automate Competitive Analysis Reports with AI

## The Problem

A product manager at a 30-person B2B SaaS company needs to present a competitive landscape update every quarter. She manually visits 8 competitor websites, reads their changelogs, checks pricing pages, scans G2 reviews, and pieces together a slide deck. Each cycle takes 12-15 hours of tedious copy-pasting and formatting. By the time it's done, some of the data is already stale. The leadership team keeps asking for more frequent updates, but there simply isn't enough time to do it monthly.

## The Solution

Use the **web-scraper** skill to pull competitor data from public sources, **competitor-alternatives** to structure the comparison, and **report-generator** to produce a polished, shareable report. The agent handles the entire pipeline from data collection through formatted output.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install web-scraper competitor-alternatives report-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define your competitor landscape

Tell your AI agent what to track:

> I need a competitive analysis report. Our competitors are: Acme Analytics, DataPulse, MetricFlow, and ChartBase. For each, I need: pricing tiers, key features shipped in the last 90 days, positioning statement from their homepage, and any notable G2 review trends. Output as a structured markdown report.

### 2. The agent scrapes competitor sources

The agent visits each competitor's website, pricing page, changelog, and public review profiles. It extracts structured data points:

```text
Scraping competitor data...
- Acme Analytics: pricing page (3 tiers found), changelog (7 entries last 90 days), G2 profile (4.3 stars, 187 reviews)
- DataPulse: pricing page (4 tiers found), changelog (12 entries last 90 days), G2 profile (4.1 stars, 94 reviews)
- MetricFlow: pricing page (2 tiers found), changelog (4 entries last 90 days), G2 profile (4.6 stars, 312 reviews)
- ChartBase: pricing page (3 tiers found), changelog (9 entries last 90 days), G2 profile (3.9 stars, 56 reviews)
```

### 3. The agent builds the comparison matrix

Using the scraped data, the agent generates a structured feature-by-feature comparison and identifies gaps and opportunities:

```text
Generating competitive comparison matrix...
- Feature parity analysis: 23 features compared across 4 competitors
- Pricing comparison: normalized to per-seat monthly pricing
- Recent momentum: ranked by shipping velocity and review growth
- Gap analysis: 3 features where we lag, 5 where we lead
```

### 4. Review the formatted report

The agent produces a markdown report with executive summary, detailed comparisons, and strategic recommendations:

```text
Report generated: competitive-analysis-q1-2026.md

Sections:
1. Executive Summary (key shifts since last quarter)
2. Competitor Profiles (one page each)
3. Feature Comparison Matrix
4. Pricing Landscape
5. Review Sentiment Analysis
6. Strategic Recommendations
```

### 5. Schedule recurring updates

> Set this up as a monthly report. Same competitors, same format. Flag anything that changed significantly from the previous month.

The agent diffs against the previous report and highlights material changes like new pricing tiers, major feature launches, or review score swings.

### 6. Generate presentation-ready slides

> Convert the executive summary and key findings into a 10-slide deck I can present at the next leadership meeting.

The agent formats the highlights into a clean presentation structure with comparison charts and strategic takeaways that leadership can act on immediately.

## Real-World Example

Lena is a product lead at a 25-person analytics startup. Every quarter she spends two full days building a competitive landscape deck for the board meeting.

1. She tells the agent to track four direct competitors across pricing, features, and reviews
2. The agent scrapes all public sources and builds a structured comparison in under 10 minutes
3. It flags that one competitor dropped their enterprise tier price by 30% and another shipped a real-time dashboard feature
4. Lena reviews the report, adds her strategic commentary, and presents it to the board
5. The next month, the agent runs the same analysis and highlights only what changed — saving Lena 11 hours per cycle
6. After three months, the quarterly report includes trend data showing how each competitor's positioning shifted over time — something that was impossible with point-in-time manual snapshots

The leadership team starts making pricing and feature decisions based on the competitive data for the first time, and Lena's quarterly presentation prep drops from two full days to 45 minutes of review and commentary.

### Tips for Better Results

- Keep your competitor list focused — 4-6 direct competitors gives the best signal-to-noise ratio
- Include both direct competitors (same product category) and indirect competitors (different product, same problem)
- Have the agent track specific pages: pricing, changelog, about, and careers (hiring velocity signals growth)
- Compare reports month-over-month to spot trends, not just snapshots
- Add your own product data so the agent can position you against each competitor
- Export the comparison matrix to a spreadsheet for stakeholders who prefer that format
- Track competitor job postings — hiring patterns reveal strategic direction before product launches
- Include customer review sentiment trends, not just star ratings — a competitor dropping from 4.5 to 4.2 tells a different story than one steady at 4.0
- Set up alerts for major changes like pricing page updates or new product launches between scheduled reports
- Archive each report so you can track competitor evolution over quarters, not just the latest snapshot
