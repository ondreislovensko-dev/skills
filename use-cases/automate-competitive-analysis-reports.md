# Automate Competitive Analysis Reports with AI

## The Problem

A product manager at a 30-person B2B SaaS company needs to present a competitive landscape update every quarter. She manually visits 8 competitor websites, reads their changelogs, checks pricing pages, scans G2 reviews, and pieces together a slide deck. Each cycle takes 12-15 hours of tedious copy-pasting and formatting. By the time it is done, some of the data is already stale. The leadership team keeps asking for more frequent updates, but there simply is not enough time to do it monthly.

The worst part is not the time — it is the missed signals. Between quarterly reports, a competitor dropped their enterprise tier price by 30% and she did not find out until a sales rep lost a deal two weeks later. Another competitor shipped a real-time dashboard feature that customers started asking about during demos. Point-in-time snapshots miss the story between the snapshots, and the story between the snapshots is where competitive threats actually materialize. By the time a pricing change shows up in the next quarterly report, the sales team has already lost deals they could have countered.

## The Solution

Use the **web-scraper** skill to pull competitor data from public sources, **competitor-alternatives** to structure the comparison, and **report-generator** to produce a polished, shareable report. The agent handles the entire pipeline from data collection through formatted output.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Define Your Competitor Landscape

```text
I need a competitive analysis report. Our competitors are: Acme Analytics, DataPulse, MetricFlow, and ChartBase. For each, I need: pricing tiers, key features shipped in the last 90 days, positioning statement from their homepage, and any notable G2 review trends. Output as a structured markdown report.
```

Four competitors, four data sources each (homepage, pricing page, changelog, G2 profile). That is 16 pages to scrape and synthesize — the kind of repetitive work that takes a human 3-4 hours of context switching between browser tabs, spreadsheets, and slide decks. And that is just the first pass — interpreting the data and synthesizing it into insights takes another 4-5 hours on top.

### Step 2: Scrape Competitor Sources

Each competitor's public presence gets scraped systematically. Rather than dumping raw HTML, the scraper extracts structured data — pricing tiers with amounts, changelog entries with dates and categories, G2 review scores with trend direction:

| Competitor | Pricing Tiers | Changelog (90 days) | G2 Rating | G2 Reviews |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Acme Analytics | 3 tiers | 7 updates | 4.3 stars | 187 reviews |
| DataPulse | 4 tiers | 12 updates | 4.1 stars | 94 reviews |
| MetricFlow | 2 tiers | 4 updates | 4.6 stars | 312 reviews |
| ChartBase | 3 tiers | 9 updates | 3.9 stars | 56 reviews |

Even this summary table tells a story. DataPulse shipped 12 changelog entries in 90 days — aggressive velocity that suggests a well-funded engineering push. MetricFlow has the highest G2 rating and the most reviews by a wide margin, suggesting strong product-market fit and active customer advocacy. ChartBase's 3.9 rating with only 56 reviews is a warning sign — low review volume means either a small customer base or disengaged users, and the sub-4.0 rating suggests the engaged ones are not entirely happy.

The changelog data reveals what each competitor is investing in — and investment patterns predict strategic direction more reliably than press releases:

- **Acme Analytics** — 7 updates focused on enterprise features (SSO, audit log, custom roles, SOC 2 compliance). They are moving upmarket toward larger contracts.
- **DataPulse** — 12 updates, all integrations (12 new data connectors). They are building a data connectivity moat — the more integrations a customer uses, the harder it is to switch.
- **MetricFlow** — 4 updates, all AI-related (anomaly detection, forecasting, natural language queries). Betting heavily on AI as a differentiator.
- **ChartBase** — 9 updates, mostly bug fixes and minor UI improvements. Maintenance mode, not growth mode. This aligns with their stalling review velocity.

### Step 3: Build the Comparison Matrix

The raw data gets synthesized into a feature-by-feature comparison across 23 capabilities, with pricing normalized to per-seat monthly cost for apples-to-apples comparison:

**Feature parity highlights:**
- 3 features where you lag behind every competitor (API export, custom dashboards, SSO)
- 5 features where you lead (real-time alerts, data connectors, mobile app, webhooks, audit log)
- 2 features only one competitor has (Acme's AI-powered predictions, DataPulse's embedded analytics for white-labeling)

**Pricing landscape:**

| Tier | Your Price | Acme | DataPulse | MetricFlow | ChartBase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Starter | $29/seat | $25/seat | $19/seat | $35/seat | $22/seat |
| Pro | $59/seat | $49/seat | $49/seat | $79/seat | $45/seat |
| Enterprise | Custom | $99/seat | $89/seat | Custom | $79/seat |

DataPulse is aggressively undercutting on price at every tier — their Starter at $19/seat is 34% below your $29. MetricFlow charges a premium but justifies it with the highest G2 scores and the AI features nobody else has. Your pricing sits in the middle of the pack — not the cheapest, not the most expensive — which means you need clear feature differentiation to justify why someone should pick you over the cheaper option. The pricing data alone does not tell you whether to raise, lower, or hold prices — but combined with the feature comparison and review sentiment, it paints a clear picture of where you have pricing power and where you do not.

**Recent momentum rankings:**

| Metric | Leader | Runner-up | Lagging |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shipping velocity | DataPulse (12 updates) | ChartBase (9) | MetricFlow (4) |
| Review growth (quarter) | MetricFlow (+31 reviews) | Acme (+18) | ChartBase (+8) |
| Feature breadth | Acme (21/23) | You (19/23) | ChartBase (16/23) |

**Review sentiment** adds qualitative depth to the quantitative comparison. The most recent G2 reviews reveal what users actually care about:

- **Acme Analytics** — praised for enterprise features, criticized for slow onboarding and clunky UI
- **DataPulse** — praised for price and integrations, criticized for limited reporting customization
- **MetricFlow** — praised for AI features and data visualization, criticized for complexity and steep learning curve
- **ChartBase** — praised for simplicity, criticized for lack of advanced features and slow support response times

These sentiment patterns are competitive intelligence gold. Acme's users want better UX — if your product is easier to use, that is your sales pitch against Acme. DataPulse users want better reporting — which happens to be one of your 5 leading features.

### Step 4: Review the Formatted Report

The final report lands as `competitive-analysis-q1-2026.md` with six sections:

1. **Executive Summary** — key shifts since last quarter and three actionable takeaways. This is the only section most executives will read, so it carries the most important insights front and center.
2. **Competitor Profiles** — one page each with positioning, strengths, weaknesses, and recent trajectory
3. **Feature Comparison Matrix** — 23 features across all 5 products (including yours), color-coded by coverage
4. **Pricing Landscape** — normalized pricing with tier-by-tier comparison and positioning analysis
5. **Review Sentiment Analysis** — what customers praise and complain about for each competitor, extracted from the most recent 20 G2 reviews per product
6. **Strategic Recommendations** — prioritized actions based on competitive gaps and opportunities, with estimated effort and impact

### Step 5: Schedule Recurring Updates

```text
Set this up as a monthly report. Same competitors, same format. Flag anything that changed significantly from the previous month.
```

Monthly runs compare against the previous report and surface only material changes. Instead of re-reading the entire competitive landscape each month, the diff-based approach highlights what actually moved:

- **Pricing changes** — new tiers, price increases or decreases, removed plans, free trial modifications
- **Major feature launches** — from changelogs and product pages, with assessment of competitive impact
- **Review score swings** — a 0.3-point drop in G2 rating signals something worth investigating; a sustained climb signals a competitor getting stronger
- **Positioning shifts** — homepage messaging changes often signal strategic pivots before they show up in product changes
- **Team growth signals** — if a competitor's careers page goes from 3 engineering openings to 15, that signals investment before the features ship

The first monthly diff might say: "DataPulse dropped Starter tier from $19 to $15/seat. Acme added AI-powered anomaly detection to their Pro tier. MetricFlow's G2 score dropped from 4.6 to 4.4 — three recent reviews mention reliability issues with the new forecasting feature." That is the actionable signal, delivered without the 12 hours of manual scraping.

Over time, the monthly diffs build a competitive timeline that reveals strategic patterns. After six months, you can see that DataPulse drops prices every quarter (a race-to-the-bottom strategy), that Acme ships one enterprise feature per month (steadily moving upmarket), and that MetricFlow's review scores stabilize after they fix the forecasting bugs (a temporary setback, not a trend). This kind of longitudinal analysis is impossible with quarterly point-in-time snapshots.

### Step 6: Generate Presentation-Ready Slides

```text
Convert the executive summary and key findings into a 10-slide deck I can present at the next leadership meeting.
```

The report content gets restructured into a presentation flow:

1. Market overview — total addressable market size, growth rate, and where you fit
2. Competitive positioning map — 2x2 matrix of price vs. feature breadth, showing where each competitor sits
3. What we lead on — the 5 features where you are ahead, with customer quotes from G2 that validate the advantage
4. What we lag on — the 3 gaps and a recommended prioritization for closing them
5. Pricing analysis — tier-by-tier comparison with win/loss rate data if available
6. Threat assessment — who is most dangerous and why, based on momentum and investment signals
7. Recommended actions — what to build, what to price, what to message differently

Each slide has one key takeaway — not a wall of text, but a single insight that leadership can act on immediately. The deck is designed to provoke decisions, not just inform: "DataPulse is undercutting us by 34% at Starter tier — do we compete on price or differentiate on features?"

## Real-World Example

Lena is a product lead at a 25-person analytics startup. Every quarter she spends two full days building a competitive landscape deck for the board meeting. The process is the same each time: visit 8 websites, screenshot pricing pages, read changelogs, scan reviews, copy everything into slides, and format it. By the time she presents, some of the data is already two weeks old.

She sets up the agent to track four direct competitors across pricing, features, and reviews. The first report takes under 10 minutes to generate — the same analysis that used to take 12-15 hours. It immediately flags something she missed: one competitor dropped their enterprise tier price by 30% the previous month, which explains two recently lost deals the sales team had been puzzling over. Armed with this data, the sales team adjusts their pitch to emphasize features the cheaper competitor lacks.

The monthly cadence changes everything. Instead of quarterly snapshots with blind spots between them, Lena sees every pricing change, feature launch, and review trend within weeks of it happening. After three months, the quarterly report includes trend data showing how each competitor's positioning shifted over time — DataPulse is racing to the bottom on price while expanding integrations, MetricFlow is doubling down on premium AI features, and ChartBase appears to be losing steam based on declining review velocity and a stagnant changelog.

The leadership team starts making pricing and feature decisions based on competitive data for the first time. The decision to prioritize SSO and custom dashboards — the three features where every competitor was ahead — comes directly from the gap analysis. The decision *not* to match DataPulse's price cuts comes from the review sentiment data showing that DataPulse users complain about limited reporting, which is exactly where Lena's product leads.

Lena's quarterly presentation prep drops from two full days to 45 minutes of review and strategic commentary. The board comments that the competitive intelligence is the most actionable part of the quarterly update — not because the data is fundamentally different from what manual analysis would produce, but because it is timely, consistent, and comprehensive enough to actually make decisions from.
