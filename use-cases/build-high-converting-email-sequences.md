# Build High-Converting Email Sequences

## The Problem

Your SaaS gets 200 trial signups per month, but only 8% convert to paid. You have a 3-email onboarding sequence that was written in an afternoon six months ago: a welcome email, a feature overview, and a "your trial is ending" reminder. Open rates are declining and the unsubscribe rate on email three is 4.2% -- people would rather leave your list than read another generic "don't forget to upgrade" message.

The real issue is that these emails treat every user the same. Someone who completed onboarding and used the product daily gets the same "here are our features" email as someone who signed up and never logged in. The sequence does not adapt to behavior, does not address objections, and does not create urgency beyond an arbitrary deadline.

## The Solution

Use **email-sequence** to architect a multi-branch behavioral email sequence with proper timing and triggers, **marketing-psychology** to apply proven persuasion principles (loss aversion, social proof, commitment consistency) at each stage, and **copy-editing** to tighten every subject line and paragraph for clarity, tone, and conversion impact.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Map the behavioral email sequence

Replace a linear drip with a branched sequence that responds to what users actually do.

> Design a 14-day trial email sequence for our project management SaaS. Branch based on: activated (created a project), engaged (invited a team member), and dormant (no login after day 2). We need different paths for each segment.

The agent produces a sequence map with 12 emails across three behavioral branches:

```text
BEHAVIORAL EMAIL SEQUENCE MAP — 14-Day Trial
==============================================

DAY 0 ── Welcome email (all users)
           │
DAY 2 ── Check: has user created a project?
           │
    ┌──────┴──────────────────────────────┐
    NO (Dormant)                    YES (Activated)
    │                                     │
Day 3: "Your empty workspace          Day 3: "3 features to try
        is waiting" (quick win)              next" (deepen usage)
    │                                     │
Day 5: "30-second setup video"       Day 5: Check: invited teammate?
    │                                  │              │
Day 8: "Teams like yours use it     YES (Engaged)   NO
        for..." (social proof)        │              │
    │                              Day 6: Collab   Day 6: "Invite your
Day 11: Final re-engage or           features       team" nudge
         sunset                       │              │
                                   Day 10: Team    Day 10: Advanced
                                     pricing        features
                                      │              │
                                   Day 13: Trial   Day 13: Trial ending
                                     ending          (loss aversion)
```

Each email has a trigger condition, send delay, and goal. The branching ensures that a power user who has already invited three teammates never receives the "here is how to create a project" email meant for dormant users.

### 2. Apply psychology principles to each email

Generic emails get ignored. Emails that tap into cognitive biases get opened and acted on.

> Apply marketing psychology to each email in the sequence. Use loss aversion for the trial-ending emails, social proof for the activation emails, and the endowed progress effect for onboarding.

The agent rewrites the email briefs with specific psychological hooks: the trial-ending email shows what the user will lose (their project data, team setup, custom workflows) rather than what they will gain by upgrading. Activation emails include specific customer metrics ("Teams using project templates save 4.2 hours/week on average"). The first onboarding email presents a progress bar showing "You're 25% set up" to trigger completion drive.

### 3. Write and polish the email copy

With the structure and psychology locked, write the actual emails and refine them for maximum impact.

> Write the full copy for all 12 emails. Keep subject lines under 50 characters. Body copy should be scannable with one clear CTA per email. Tone: helpful, not pushy.

The agent produces 12 complete emails. The copy-editing pass tightens each one: removes passive voice, cuts filler sentences, strengthens CTAs from vague ("check it out") to specific ("Create your first project in 2 minutes"), and ensures subject lines create curiosity without resorting to clickbait.

### 4. Define metrics and iteration plan

An email sequence is never finished -- it needs ongoing measurement and optimization.

> Set up tracking for the email sequence. Define success metrics for each email and the overall sequence. Include benchmarks we should aim for.

The agent defines per-email metrics (open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate) with benchmarks for B2B SaaS (25-30% open rate for triggered emails, under 0.5% unsubscribe rate), plus sequence-level metrics: trial-to-paid conversion rate by branch, time-to-activation, and revenue per email sent.

## Real-World Example

Priya ran growth at a 15-person SaaS company with a trial-to-paid conversion rate stuck at 8% for three quarters. Her existing email sequence was three generic emails sent on days 1, 7, and 13 regardless of user behavior. She ran the three-skill workflow and rebuilt the sequence from scratch.

The behavioral branching was the biggest lever. Dormant users (no login after 48 hours) now received an email with a single action: "Your empty project is waiting -- add your first task in 30 seconds" with a deep link straight to the task creation screen. That one email reactivated 23% of dormant users. The psychology-driven trial-ending email, which showed users exactly what they would lose (3 projects, 12 tasks, 2 teammates already active), lifted upgrade clicks by 67% compared to the old "your trial ends tomorrow" message.

After 60 days, trial-to-paid conversion rose from 8% to 14.2%. On 200 monthly signups at $29/user/month, that was 12 additional conversions per month -- $4,176 in new MRR from emails alone. The dormant-user branch drove 40% of the improvement, confirming that the biggest opportunity was not convincing active users to pay but getting inactive users to experience the product at all.
