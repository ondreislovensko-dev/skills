# Prepare Your Startup for SOC 2 Compliance with AI

## The Problem

Your sales team just lost a $240K annual contract because the prospect required SOC 2 Type II certification. "Come back when you're certified" — that conversation has happened three times this quarter. Enterprise buyers don't negotiate on compliance; it's a checkbox that gates the conversation.

SOC 2 consultants charge $30,000-80,000 and the process takes 6-12 months. For a startup with 8 engineers and $2M runway, that's brutal. The audit examines five trust service criteria across your entire infrastructure. Most startups discover they're failing 40-60% of controls on day one.

The hardest part is knowing where you stand. Your codebase has no access logging, CI/CD has no approval gates, encryption at rest isn't configured, and your data retention policy doesn't exist. You need a clear map of what to fix, with effort estimates.

## The Solution

Combine **security-audit**, **cicd-pipeline**, and **code-reviewer** to perform a comprehensive SOC 2 gap analysis against your actual codebase and infrastructure. Security-audit maps vulnerabilities to trust service criteria. cicd-pipeline checks deployment controls. code-reviewer identifies missing authorization and audit logging. The result is a prioritized checklist your team works through — not a consultant PDF.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install security-audit cicd-pipeline code-reviewer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Run a SOC 2 gap analysis

```
Analyze this codebase against SOC 2 Type II criteria. Focus on security, availability, and confidentiality.
```

```
SOC 2 Gap Analysis

SECURITY (CC6.x):
  ❌ CC6.1 — No RBAC (all authenticated users access all endpoints)
  ❌ CC6.3 — No audit logging for data access
  ⚠️  CC6.6 — Encryption at rest not confirmed (default DB settings)
  ✅ CC6.7 — TLS 1.2+ enforced

AVAILABILITY (A1.x):
  ❌ A1.1 — No health checks, no monitoring, no status page
  ❌ A1.2 — Single-region, no verified backups

CONFIDENTIALITY (C1.x):
  ❌ C1.1 — PII mixed with non-sensitive data, no field-level controls
  ❌ C1.2 — No data retention/deletion policy

Summary: 4/18 controls passing | Remediation: 14-18 engineering days
```

### 2. Implement audit logging

```
Add audit logging that satisfies CC6.3 — who accessed what, when, from where.
```

```
Created: src/middleware/audit-logger.ts
  Captures: userId, action, resource, ipAddress, userAgent, timestamp
  Storage: audit_logs table (append-only, partitioned by month, 90-day retention)

Updated: 23 route files with audit context
Sample: {"userId":"usr_8f2a","action":"READ","resource":"customers","ip":"10.0.1.45"}

CC6.3: ✅ Now compliant
```

### 3. Add role-based access control

```
Implement RBAC: admin (full access), manager (team data), member (own data only).
```

```
Created: src/middleware/rbac.ts (94 lines)
  Permission matrix enforced on all 34 API routes
  Added: 18 tests for permission boundaries

  ✓ member cannot access other users' data
  ✓ manager reads team data, cannot modify settings
  ✓ unauthorized → 403 + audit log entry

CC6.1: ✅ Now compliant
```

### 4. Harden CI/CD for change management

```
Update CI/CD to meet SOC 2 change management: required reviews, security scan, approval gate, deploy audit trail.
```

```
Branch protection: 1 approving review, status checks, signed commits, no direct push
Deploy pipeline: SAST scan + CVE check + production approval gate
Weekly compliance check: verifies rules active, flags bypass attempts

Deploy log: {"version":"v2.14.0","deployer":"carlos@co","approver":"sarah@co",
  "timestamp":"2026-02-17T14:23:01Z","status":"success"}

CC8.1 (change management): ✅ Now compliant
```

### 5. Generate the compliance evidence report

```
Generate a SOC 2 readiness report with compliance status and auditor-ready evidence.
```

```
Generated: SOC2-READINESS-REPORT.md

  Security:        7/8 passing (was 2/8)
  Availability:    3/4 passing (was 1/4)
  Confidentiality: 3/4 passing (was 0/4)
  Overall:         15/18 (83%)

  Remaining: vendor assessment (2d), DR test (1d), deletion evidence (30d wait)
  Evidence: audit logs, RBAC docs, CI config, encryption certs, deploy trail
  Estimated to full readiness: 3-5 days + 30-day evidence window
```

## Real-World Example

The CTO of a 12-person B2B SaaS startup was losing enterprise deals to competitors with SOC 2 certification. Three prospects in Q4 — $420K potential ARR — required it. A consultant quoted $55,000 and 9 months. With 14 months of runway, she couldn't wait.

She ran the three-skill analysis Monday. The gap analysis found 14/18 controls failing. By Wednesday: audit logging, RBAC, and encryption in place (8 controls fixed). Thursday: CI/CD hardened with approval gates and deploy audit trails (3 more). Friday: documented remaining manual items and created a 30-day evidence plan.

The startup engaged an auditor three weeks later with the auto-generated readiness report. The auditor noted controls were "surprisingly mature for this size." The observation period started immediately. Five months later: SOC 2 Type II report in hand at $12,000 (auditor fees) instead of $55,000+. First enterprise deal closed within two weeks of certification.
