# Create an API Versioning Strategy with AI

## The Problem

Your REST API has 30 active endpoints consumed by a mobile app, three partner integrations, and a public developer community. You need to redesign the user endpoint to support team-based accounts, but changing the response shape will break every existing client. Last time you made a breaking change, you just updated the endpoint and emailed partners — two integrations broke silently, one partner churned, and the mobile app crashed for users who had not updated. You need a versioning strategy, but the team cannot agree on URL versioning versus header versioning, and nobody wants to maintain two versions of every controller.

## The Solution

Use the **coding-agent** to implement API versioning infrastructure with minimal code duplication, **api-tester** to validate backward compatibility across versions, and **markdown-writer** to generate versioned API documentation and migration guides.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install coding-agent api-tester markdown-writer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Describe your API and the breaking change

```
Our Express REST API has 30 endpoints. Current base: /api/v1/
We need to introduce v2 of the user endpoints because we're adding
team-based accounts. The changes:
- GET /users/:id response adds a "teams" array and changes "plan" from
  string to object
- POST /users now requires an organizationId field
- GET /users/:id/settings is being split into /users/:id/preferences
  and /users/:id/notifications

We have ~200 active API consumers. Help me version this without breaking anyone.
```

### 2. The agent designs the versioning architecture

```
Versioning Strategy: URL path versioning with response transformers

Why URL path (not headers):
- Your consumers include mobile apps that cache aggressively
- Partner integrations are built by junior devs who may miss header requirements
- URL versioning is explicit, debuggable, and CDN-friendly

Architecture:
src/
├── routes/
│   ├── v1/              # Existing routes (unchanged)
│   │   └── users.ts
│   └── v2/              # New routes
│       └── users.ts
├── controllers/
│   └── users.ts         # Shared business logic (version-agnostic)
├── transformers/
│   ├── v1/
│   │   └── user.ts      # Shapes response for v1 clients
│   └── v2/
│       └── user.ts      # Shapes response for v2 clients
└── middleware/
    └── version.ts       # Version detection and routing

Key principle: controllers contain business logic ONCE.
Transformers handle response shape per version. No code duplication.
```

### 3. The agent implements the versioning layer

```
Generated versioning infrastructure:

1. Version middleware (src/middleware/version.ts):
   - Extracts version from URL path (/api/v1/ or /api/v2/)
   - Sets req.apiVersion for downstream use
   - Returns 400 for unsupported versions

2. Response transformers:
   v1/user.ts: returns flat plan string, omits teams array
   v2/user.ts: returns plan object with tier/limits, includes teams

3. Sunset headers for v1:
   Sunset: Sat, 17 Aug 2026 00:00:00 GMT
   Deprecation: true
   Link: </api/v2/users>; rel="successor-version"

4. Version routing (3 lines added to app.ts):
   app.use('/api/v1', v1Router);
   app.use('/api/v2', v2Router);
   app.use('/api', v2Router);  // unversioned defaults to latest
```

### 4. The agent generates backward compatibility tests

```
Generated test suite: tests/api-versioning/

v1 Backward Compatibility (23 tests):
✓ GET /api/v1/users/:id returns flat plan string
✓ GET /api/v1/users/:id does NOT include teams array
✓ POST /api/v1/users works without organizationId
✓ GET /api/v1/users/:id/settings still works (not split)
✓ All v1 response shapes match current production schema
✓ Sunset header present on all v1 responses

v2 New Behavior (18 tests):
✓ GET /api/v2/users/:id returns plan as object
✓ GET /api/v2/users/:id includes teams array
✓ POST /api/v2/users requires organizationId
✓ GET /api/v2/users/:id/settings returns 301 → /preferences
✓ New endpoints /preferences and /notifications work

Cross-version (6 tests):
✓ Same user data returns correctly shaped for both versions
✓ Creating user via v1 is readable via v2 and vice versa
✓ Invalid version /api/v3/ returns 400 with supported versions list
```

### 5. The agent writes migration documentation

```
Generated docs:
- docs/api/migration-v1-to-v2.md  (developer migration guide)
- docs/api/changelog-v2.md        (what changed and why)
- docs/api/sunset-policy.md       (timeline and process)

Migration guide includes:
- Side-by-side response comparisons (v1 vs v2)
- Code examples in JavaScript, Python, and cURL
- Breaking changes with exact field-level diffs
- Sunset timeline: v1 deprecated now, removed August 2026
- Support contact for migration questions
```

## Real-World Example

Kenji is the API lead at a 20-person SaaS startup with 200 active API consumers. They need to restructure user endpoints for a major feature launch, but their last breaking change cost them a partner and dozens of support tickets.

1. Kenji asks the agent to design a versioning strategy for their 30-endpoint API
2. The agent implements URL path versioning with response transformers — business logic stays in one place, only the response shape varies per version
3. It generates 47 tests covering backward compatibility, new behavior, and cross-version consistency
4. The agent writes a migration guide with code examples in three languages and a clear sunset timeline
5. Kenji's team ships v2 with zero breaking changes for existing consumers, the migration guide gets positive feedback from partners, and v1 consumers gradually migrate over the next four months
