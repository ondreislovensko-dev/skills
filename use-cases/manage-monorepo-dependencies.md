# Manage Monorepo Dependencies with AI

## The Problem

Your monorepo has 20 packages and 4 apps. React is on three different versions. TypeScript configs are subtly different across workspaces. A junior developer adds `lodash` directly to an app instead of the shared utils package, creating the fourth copy. Nobody knows which packages depend on which, builds randomly fail, and "it works on my machine" is the team motto. Dependency chaos costs hours per week in debugging phantom type errors and version conflicts.

## The Solution

Use the **monorepo-manager** skill to audit, sync, and maintain dependencies across all workspaces. Combine with **security-audit** to catch vulnerable transitive dependencies and **code-reviewer** to review dependency changes before merging.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install monorepo-manager
npx terminal-skills install security-audit
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Map the monorepo structure

```
Analyze our monorepo structure. Show me all packages, their internal dependencies, and the tooling we're using.
```

The agent scans the workspace and produces a map:

```
Monorepo: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
Root: 14 packages across apps/ and packages/

Internal dependency graph:
  packages/types → (no deps)
  packages/utils → types
  packages/ui → types, utils
  packages/database → types
  apps/web → ui, utils, database, types
  apps/api → database, utils, types
  apps/admin → ui, utils, types

No circular dependencies detected ✅
```

### 2. Audit dependency versions

```
Find all dependency version mismatches across our packages. Show the worst offenders.
```

```
## Version Mismatches (7 found)

| Dependency    | Versions in use           | Packages affected |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| react         | 18.3.1, 18.2.0           | 3 packages        |
| typescript    | 5.4.2, 5.3.3, 5.2.2      | 8 packages        |
| zod           | 3.22.4, 3.21.1           | 4 packages        |
| @types/node   | 20.11.5, 20.10.0, 20.9.0 | 6 packages        |
| eslint        | 9.0.0, 8.57.0            | 5 packages        |
| vitest        | 1.3.1, 1.2.0             | 4 packages        |
| date-fns      | 3.3.1, 2.30.0            | 2 packages        |

Highest risk: date-fns (major version split), eslint (major version split)
```

### 3. Fix mismatches with a plan

```
Sync all dependencies to their latest compatible versions. Show me what will change before applying.
```

The agent produces a migration plan with breaking change warnings, then updates all package.json files and runs the install command.

### 4. Check for security issues in the unified deps

```
Now run a security audit on our updated dependencies.
```

The agent scans for known CVEs in the dependency tree and reports any vulnerable packages that need attention.

### 5. Set up ongoing enforcement

```
How do I prevent version drift from happening again?
```

The agent suggests:
- Using pnpm `catalog:` protocol to pin versions in one place
- Adding a CI check that fails on version mismatches
- Configuring Renovate or Dependabot for automated updates
- Adding a `syncpack` config for version enforcement

## Real-World Example

Priya leads a frontend platform team at a 30-person B2B startup. Their monorepo grew from 3 packages to 22 over two years. Different teams added dependencies independently, and nobody owned the dependency graph.

1. Priya asks the agent: "Audit our monorepo dependencies and find all version conflicts"
2. The agent finds 14 version mismatches, including three major version splits
3. She asks: "Which mismatches are causing actual build failures?"
4. The agent identifies that TypeScript 5.2 vs 5.4 in different packages causes type inference differences breaking the shared UI library
5. She asks: "Sync TypeScript to 5.4.2 everywhere and verify builds"
6. The agent updates 8 package.json files, runs `pnpm install && pnpm turbo build`, confirms all packages compile
7. Build times also improve because Turborepo can now cache more effectively with consistent configs

Total time: 20 minutes. Previous manual attempt took a full sprint day and broke staging.
