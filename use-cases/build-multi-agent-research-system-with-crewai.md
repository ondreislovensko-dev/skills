# Build a Multi-Agent Research System with CrewAI

Elena is head of strategy at a Series B startup. Every quarter she needs competitive intelligence reports covering 15 competitors, market sizing, trend analysis, and strategic recommendations. Currently, a junior analyst spends 2 weeks compiling each report — searching the web, reading earnings calls, analyzing product changelogs, and writing up findings.

Elena builds a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents handle different aspects of research, validate each other's findings, and produce a structured report — reducing 2 weeks to 10 minutes per run.

## Step 1: RAG Knowledge Base with Haystack

Before the agents can research, they need access to the company's existing intelligence: past reports, competitor profiles, industry analyses, and internal strategy documents.

```python
# knowledge_base.py — Build searchable knowledge base
from haystack import Pipeline, Document
from haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder, SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder
from haystack.components.writers import DocumentWriter
from haystack.components.retrievers.in_memory import InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever
from haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore
from haystack.components.converters import PyPDFToDocument, MarkdownToDocument
from haystack.components.preprocessors import DocumentSplitter
from pathlib import Path

document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()

def index_documents(docs_dir: str):
    """Index all documents from a directory into the knowledge base.

    Args:
        docs_dir: Path to directory containing PDFs and markdown files
    """
    documents = []
    
    for path in Path(docs_dir).rglob("*.md"):
        converter = MarkdownToDocument()
        result = converter.run(sources=[path])
        for doc in result["documents"]:
            doc.meta["source"] = str(path)
            doc.meta["type"] = "internal"
            documents.append(doc)

    for path in Path(docs_dir).rglob("*.pdf"):
        converter = PyPDFToDocument()
        result = converter.run(sources=[path])
        for doc in result["documents"]:
            doc.meta["source"] = str(path)
            doc.meta["type"] = "report"
            documents.append(doc)

    # Split into chunks
    splitter = DocumentSplitter(split_by="sentence", split_length=5, split_overlap=1)
    chunks = splitter.run(documents=documents)["documents"]

    # Embed and store
    indexing = Pipeline()
    indexing.add_component("embedder", SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder(
        model="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5",
    ))
    indexing.add_component("writer", DocumentWriter(document_store=document_store))
    indexing.connect("embedder", "writer")
    indexing.run({"embedder": {"documents": chunks}})

    print(f"Indexed {len(chunks)} chunks from {len(documents)} documents")

# Build retrieval pipeline
def build_retriever():
    retriever = Pipeline()
    retriever.add_component("embedder", SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder(
        model="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5",
    ))
    retriever.add_component("retriever", InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever(
        document_store=document_store, top_k=10,
    ))
    retriever.connect("embedder.embedding", "retriever.query_embedding")
    return retriever
```

## Step 2: Type-Safe Data Extraction with PydanticAI

Each piece of competitive intelligence is extracted into validated Pydantic models — ensuring consistent data quality across all agents.

```python
# models.py — Structured output models
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic_ai import Agent

class CompetitorProfile(BaseModel):
    """Validated competitor data extracted by AI agents."""
    name: str
    website: str
    founded: int
    funding_total: str = Field(description="Total funding raised, e.g. '$45M'")
    employee_count: str = Field(description="Estimated range, e.g. '50-100'")
    positioning: str = Field(description="One-sentence market positioning")
    key_products: list[str]
    target_market: str
    pricing_model: str
    strengths: list[str] = Field(min_length=2, max_length=5)
    weaknesses: list[str] = Field(min_length=2, max_length=5)
    recent_moves: list[str] = Field(description="Notable actions in last 6 months")

class MarketTrend(BaseModel):
    """Validated market trend observation."""
    trend_name: str
    description: str
    evidence: list[str] = Field(min_length=2, description="Data points supporting this trend")
    impact: str = Field(description="Low/Medium/High impact on our business")
    timeline: str = Field(description="When this trend will peak")
    opportunity: str = Field(description="How we can capitalize on this trend")

class StrategicRecommendation(BaseModel):
    """Validated strategic recommendation."""
    title: str
    priority: str = Field(description="P0 (critical) / P1 (high) / P2 (medium)")
    description: str
    rationale: str
    effort: str = Field(description="Small (1-2 weeks) / Medium (1-2 months) / Large (quarter+)")
    expected_impact: str
    risks: list[str]

# PydanticAI agent for type-safe extraction
competitor_extractor = Agent(
    "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    result_type=CompetitorProfile,
    system_prompt="Extract structured competitor data from the provided research. Be precise with numbers and dates.",
)
```

# Tasks
research_task = Task(

# Assemble and run
crew = Crew(

    process=Process.sequential,

result = crew.kickoff(inputs={
    "market": "AI developer tools",

})
```

## Results

Elena runs the system every Monday morning. The crew produces a 3,000-word report with structured competitor profiles, trend analysis, and prioritized recommendations in 10 minutes.

- **Research time**: 2 weeks → 10 minutes per run
- **Coverage**: 15 competitors analyzed with 45+ data points each (vs. 5-8 data points manually)
- **Consistency**: Pydantic validation ensures every competitor profile has all required fields
- **Historical context**: RAG retrieves relevant insights from 2 years of past reports
- **Cost**: ~$2.50 per report run (4 agents × ~15K tokens each) vs. $4,000 analyst time
- **Frequency**: Weekly CI reports (was quarterly due to analyst bandwidth)
- **Accuracy**: Strategy team rates AI reports 8.2/10 vs. 7.8/10 for analyst reports (after 3 months of tuning)
