# Build a Connected Knowledge System with Notion and Obsidian

## The Problem

A product manager at a 60-person startup uses Obsidian for personal research notes, competitive analysis, and meeting reflections, but the team collaborates in Notion for product specs, roadmaps, and decision logs. Good insights stay trapped in the personal vault and never reach the team.

When someone asks "why did we decide X?" the answer exists in an Obsidian note from a customer call three months ago, but the Notion decision log has no context. The PM copies and reformats content between the two systems manually, which takes time and results in stale duplicates. Last quarter, the team re-debated a pricing decision for two hours because the original reasoning was locked in the PM's personal notes and never made it to the shared decision log.

## The Solution

Use the **obsidian** skill to structure the personal research vault and the **notion** skill to maintain the team workspace, then build a workflow that promotes personal insights to shared team knowledge when they mature.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Structure the Obsidian vault for research capture

Set up the personal vault with areas that map to team Notion databases:

> Create an Obsidian vault structure for product research. Top-level folders: /research (competitive analysis, market trends), /customers (call notes, feedback themes), /ideas (feature concepts, experiments), /decisions (personal reasoning notes), and /weekly (weekly synthesis notes). Create a template for customer call notes with frontmatter fields: date, customer, company, arr-tier, topics, and a "share-to-notion" boolean flag. Create a weekly synthesis template that links to the most important notes from the week and has a "team-summary" section meant for sharing.

The "share-to-notion" flag is the key design decision. Not every personal note needs to reach the team. The PM deliberately marks notes for sharing when the insight is mature enough to be useful, preventing half-formed thoughts from cluttering the team workspace.

### 2. Build the Notion team workspace structure

Set up Notion databases and pages that receive promoted insights:

> In the Product team Notion workspace, create these databases: Customer Insights (properties: Customer, Date, Theme, Source, Impact, Status), Competitive Intel (properties: Competitor, Category, Finding, Date, Evidence Link), Product Decisions (properties: Decision, Date, Context, Alternatives Considered, Outcome), and Research Library (properties: Title, Topic, Author, Date, Summary). Create a linked view on the Product Hub page showing the 10 most recent entries from each database. Add a "Raw Source" property to each database to track whether the insight originated from Obsidian research.

The Notion databases use structured properties rather than free-form pages because structured data enables filtering, sorting, and dashboarding. A designer can filter Customer Insights by "Theme: data-export" to see every customer who mentioned that feature.

### 3. Promote customer insights from Obsidian to Notion

Move mature customer insights from the personal vault to the team database:

> Review all Obsidian customer call notes from the last 2 weeks with the "share-to-notion" flag set to true. For each flagged note, create a new entry in the Notion Customer Insights database. Map the Obsidian frontmatter: customer to Customer, date to Date, topics to Theme. Summarize the key findings from the note body into the Notion "Summary" field (3-4 sentences, not the full call notes). Set Source to "Customer Call" and Status to "New". For the note from the February 12 call with Acme Corp where they requested bulk export functionality, tag the Notion entry with Impact "High" since three other customers asked for the same feature this month.

Summaries work better than full notes in the team context. Call notes include tangents, personal observations, and incomplete thoughts that add noise. A 3-4 sentence summary of the key finding respects the team's attention.

### 4. Sync competitive analysis to the team

Convert personal research notes into structured competitive intelligence:

> Process all Obsidian notes in /research/competitive/ modified in the last month. For each note about a competitor, create or update entries in the Notion Competitive Intel database. Extract specific findings: DataRival launched a self-serve analytics tier at $29/month (finding), they hired 12 engineers from their job postings (finding), their G2 rating dropped from 4.6 to 4.3 after a pricing change (finding). Each finding becomes a separate Notion row with the competitor name, category (pricing, product, team, reputation), date discovered, and a link back to the evidence. Do not share raw speculation from the Obsidian notes, only findings with evidence.

Separating findings from speculation is important. "DataRival launched at $29/month" is a fact the team can act on. "I think they're struggling financially" is speculation that does not belong in the shared database.

### 5. Generate the weekly product intelligence brief

Combine insights from both systems into a weekly team digest:

> Create a weekly product intelligence brief for the week of February 17, 2026. Pull from Notion: new customer insights added this week (4 entries), competitive intel updates (2 findings about DataRival, 1 about CloudMetrics), and any product decisions made. Pull from Obsidian: the weekly synthesis note's "team-summary" section, which includes emerging themes and recommendations. Compile into a Notion page under /Weekly Briefs/ with sections: Key Customer Signals, Competitive Movements, Decisions Made, and Recommendations for Next Week. Keep the brief under 500 words so people actually read it.

The weekly brief is the forcing function that ensures knowledge flows from personal research to team awareness on a predictable cadence. Without it, insights accumulate silently in the Obsidian vault and never influence decisions.

## Real-World Example

The PM spends Tuesday morning taking notes in Obsidian during three customer calls. Two of the three customers independently mention needing better data export options, so the PM flags both notes with "share-to-notion: true" and tags them with the "data-export" topic. On Wednesday, the promotion workflow creates two Customer Insights entries in Notion, and the team's product designer sees them in the linked view. By Thursday standup, the designer has already sketched a bulk export flow.

On Friday, the weekly brief synthesizes the customer signals alongside competitive intel that DataRival just launched the exact export feature these customers want. The brief triggers a reprioritization conversation that moves the export feature from Q3 to Q2. Without the connected system, those call notes would have sat in the PM's personal vault until someone asked the right question months later. The total time spent on knowledge transfer drops from 3 hours of manual reformatting per week to 30 minutes of flagging and reviewing.
