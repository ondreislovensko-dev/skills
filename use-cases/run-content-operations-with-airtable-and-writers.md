# Run Content Operations with Airtable and AI Writers

## The Problem

A B2B SaaS marketing team publishes 8 blog posts per month, plus 4 case studies and 2 whitepapers per quarter. The content calendar lives in a Google Sheet that nobody updates, drafts sit in random Google Docs folders, and the review process happens over Slack threads that get lost.

The content manager cannot answer basic questions: How many posts are in the pipeline? Which ones are blocked on SME review? What topics have they already covered this year? Last month, two writers independently produced articles on the same topic because nobody checked the backlog. The duplicate was only discovered after both articles were fully drafted, wasting $1,200 in freelancer costs.

## The Solution

Use the **airtable** skill to build a structured content operations database with pipeline tracking, and the **content-writer** skill to generate first drafts from briefs, reducing the time from content idea to published article.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Build the content operations base in Airtable

Create the database structure for managing the full content lifecycle:

> Create an Airtable base called "Content Operations" with these tables. Content Pipeline: fields for Title (text), Slug (text), Topic Cluster (single select: product-led-growth, developer-experience, data-engineering, security, case-studies), Status (single select: Idea, Brief Ready, Draft In Progress, In Review, Approved, Published), Author (linked to People table), Reviewer (linked to People table), Target Publish Date (date), Actual Publish Date (date), Word Count (number), SEO Keyword (text), Target Audience (single select: developers, engineering-managers, CTOs), and Draft URL (URL). People table: Name, Role, Email, Capacity (number of articles per month). Topic Registry: Topic, Cluster, Times Covered, Last Published Date, Related Keywords. Create a view called "Editorial Board" on Content Pipeline showing only items with status Brief Ready through In Review, grouped by Status and sorted by Target Publish Date.

The Topic Registry table prevents the duplicate article problem. Before assigning a new topic, the content manager checks whether it has been covered before and when, turning an institutional memory problem into a database query.

### 2. Generate content briefs from topic ideas

Turn approved topic ideas into structured briefs that writers can execute:

> For the content pipeline item "Why Feature Flags Reduce Deployment Risk" (topic cluster: developer-experience, target audience: engineering-managers, SEO keyword: "feature flags deployment"), generate a content brief. Include: working title, target word count (1,800), article structure with H2 and H3 headings, key points to cover under each section, 3 competitor articles to reference and differentiate from, a specific angle that makes this article unique (focus on the risk reduction math with real incident cost data), suggested internal links to 2 existing articles, and a CTA aligned with the product's feature flag functionality. Update the Airtable record status to "Brief Ready" and attach the brief to the record.

A good brief answers "what makes this article different from the 10 existing articles on this topic?" Without a specific angle, the writer produces generic content that does not rank or convert.

### 3. Draft articles from approved briefs

Generate first drafts based on the content briefs stored in Airtable:

> Pull the content brief for "Why Feature Flags Reduce Deployment Risk" from Airtable and generate a first draft. Follow the brief structure exactly. Write for engineering managers who deploy to production 3-5 times per week. Use a practical, evidence-based tone. Include a specific example: a deployment at a fintech company that caused a 23-minute outage costing $47,000, and how a feature flag kill switch would have reduced impact to under 2 minutes. Include code snippets showing a basic feature flag implementation in TypeScript. Target 1,800 words. Update the Airtable status to "Draft In Progress" and set the word count field.

First drafts should be treated as starting points, not finished products. The writer then spends 1-2 hours adding personal experience, refining the voice, and verifying technical accuracy rather than staring at a blank page.

### 4. Track editorial progress and bottlenecks

Monitor the content pipeline for overdue items and capacity issues:

> Query the Airtable Content Pipeline for the current editorial status. Show: items in each status bucket with their target publish dates, any items where target publish date is within 5 days and status is still "Draft In Progress" or earlier (at risk of missing deadline), articles that have been "In Review" for more than 3 business days (bottleneck), and author capacity this month (compare assigned articles against each person's monthly capacity in the People table). Flag that Sarah has 4 articles assigned this month against a capacity of 3, and the "Data Pipeline Best Practices" article has been in review for 6 days with no feedback from the SME reviewer.

The bottleneck detection is the most actionable part of the pipeline view. Most content delays come from the review stage, not the writing stage. Making review latency visible puts social pressure on reviewers to respond promptly.

### 5. Generate the monthly content performance report

Compile publishing metrics and pipeline health from Airtable data:

> Generate the February 2026 content report from Airtable. Published this month: list all items with status "Published" and Actual Publish Date in February, showing title, author, word count, and topic cluster. Pipeline health: count items in each status, average days from "Brief Ready" to "Published" this month, and number of items that missed their target publish date. Topic coverage: query the Topic Registry to show which clusters have been covered this quarter and which have gaps. Highlight that the "security" cluster has only 1 article published this quarter against a target of 3. Recommend 2 specific topic ideas for the security cluster based on gaps in the Topic Registry.

Monthly reporting reveals patterns that weekly tracking misses. If the "developer-experience" cluster consistently overperforms while "security" underperforms, the team may need a dedicated security-focused writer or SME.

## Real-World Example

The content manager starts March planning by reviewing the Airtable Editorial Board view. The pipeline shows 14 items: 3 published in February, 2 in review, 4 drafts in progress, and 5 ideas awaiting briefs. The bottleneck report flags that the "Observability for Microservices" article has been stuck in SME review for 8 days, so the manager pings the reviewer directly. The capacity check shows that the team can handle 8 articles in March but has 11 scheduled, so 3 get pushed to April.

A first draft for the feature flags article is generated from the brief in 15 minutes instead of the usual 6 hours a writer spends on a first pass. The writer then spends 2 hours refining, adding personal experience, and polishing rather than staring at a blank page. The duplicate topic problem disappears because the Topic Registry shows every subject that has been covered and when. By the end of Q1, the team publishes 24 articles (up from 18 the previous quarter) with no increase in headcount, and the content manager can answer any pipeline question from a single Airtable view.
