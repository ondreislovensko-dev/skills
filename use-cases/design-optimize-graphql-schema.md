# Design and Optimize a GraphQL Schema with AI

## The Problem

Your team is building a GraphQL API for a multi-tenant project management app. The initial schema grew organically — now you have 47 types, queries that trigger 200+ SQL statements per request, and clients complaining about 3-second response times. Some queries return 5MB of nested data because there's no pagination. The mobile app only needs 10 fields but gets 85. Nobody wants to refactor because the schema is the contract with three frontend teams.

## The Solution

Use AI to audit your existing schema (or design one from scratch), identify N+1 query patterns, add proper pagination and field-level complexity limits, and generate optimized resolvers with DataLoader patterns. The `graphql` skill handles schema structure and the `sql-optimizer` skill fixes the underlying queries.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install graphql sql-optimizer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit your existing schema

```
Here's our GraphQL schema (schema.graphql, 820 lines). Analyze it for: naming inconsistencies, missing pagination on list fields, overly nested types that cause deep query chains, nullable fields that should be non-null, and any anti-patterns.
```

The agent reviews your schema and produces a detailed audit:

```
Schema Audit — 47 types, 23 queries, 14 mutations

Naming Issues:
  - Inconsistent casing: `getUser` vs `projectsList` vs `fetch_tasks`
    Recommendation: Use camelCase verbs consistently (user, projects, tasks)
  - 3 types use plural names (Tasks, Projects) — should be singular

Pagination Missing:
  - projects: [Project!]! — returns unbounded list (currently 12,000 rows)
  - tasks(projectId: ID!): [Task!]! — no limit, some projects have 3,000+ tasks
  - comments(taskId: ID!): [Comment!]! — same issue
  Recommendation: Use Relay-style cursor pagination for all list fields

Deep Nesting Risks:
  - Query path: projects → tasks → comments → author → projects creates circular reference
  - Maximum depth reachable: unlimited (no depth limiting configured)
  - A malicious query could request: { projects { tasks { comments { author { projects { tasks ... }}}}}}

Missing Non-Null:
  - User.email is nullable but your DB has NOT NULL constraint — should be String!
  - Task.title same issue — 14 fields total where schema is looser than DB
```

### 2. Fix the schema structure

```
Redesign the schema following your recommendations. Keep backward compatibility where possible — add @deprecated directives for fields we'll remove later. Add Relay-style pagination, input types for mutations, and a query complexity limit of 1000 points.
```

### 3. Detect and fix N+1 queries

```
Here are our resolver files (resolvers/ directory). Find every N+1 query pattern and generate DataLoader implementations to batch them. Show me the before/after SQL query counts for a typical "list projects with tasks and assignees" request.
```

The agent analyzes resolver code and SQL logs:

```
N+1 Query Analysis:

Query: { projects(first: 20) { tasks { assignee { name } } } }

BEFORE (current resolvers):
  1 query: SELECT * FROM projects LIMIT 20
  20 queries: SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE project_id = ? (one per project)
  147 queries: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ? (one per task assignee)
  Total: 168 SQL queries, ~2.8 seconds

AFTER (with DataLoader):
  1 query: SELECT * FROM projects LIMIT 20
  1 query: SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE project_id IN (?, ?, ... ?)
  1 query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?, ?, ... ?)
  Total: 3 SQL queries, ~45ms

Generated DataLoaders:
  - tasksByProjectIdLoader: batches task lookups by project
  - userByIdLoader: batches user lookups by ID
  - commentsByTaskIdLoader: batches comment lookups by task
```

### 4. Add query complexity and depth limits

```
Configure query complexity analysis. Assign costs: scalar fields = 0, object fields = 1, list fields with pagination = cost × first argument. Set max depth to 7 and max complexity to 1000. Generate the middleware code.
```

## Real-World Example

Tomas is a backend lead at a 15-person B2B startup building a project management tool. Three frontend teams (web, iOS, Android) consume their GraphQL API. The mobile team reported that the dashboard query takes 4.2 seconds and transfers 3.1MB.

1. Tomas feeds the 820-line schema to the agent — gets back 23 specific issues in 40 seconds
2. The agent redesigns the schema with cursor pagination, reducing the dashboard payload from 3.1MB to 180KB
3. N+1 detection finds 8 resolver patterns causing 200+ queries — DataLoaders reduce it to 11 queries
4. The dashboard query drops from 4.2 seconds to 290ms
5. Complexity limiting prevents the abuse query that previously crashed their staging server
