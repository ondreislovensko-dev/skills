# Build Email Campaign Performance Analyzer with AI

## The Problem

A growth marketer at a 20-person SaaS startup sends 4-6 email campaigns per week across onboarding sequences, product updates, and promotional blasts. Campaign data is exported as CSV files from their email platform, but nobody has time to do deep analysis. They look at open rates in the dashboard and move on. They have no idea which subject line patterns perform best, what send times drive the most clicks, whether their onboarding sequence has a drop-off point, or how campaign performance trends over time. Decisions about what to send next are based on gut feeling rather than data.

## The Solution

Use the **data-analysis** skill to find patterns in campaign metrics, the **excel-processor** to wrangle exported CSV data, and the **report-generator** to produce actionable insights. The agent analyzes months of campaign data and surfaces what actually drives engagement.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install data-analysis excel-processor report-generator
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Import your campaign data

Tell the agent what to analyze:

```
I have 6 months of email campaign data exported as CSV files in the campaigns/ folder. Each file has: campaign name, send date, subject line, recipient count, opens, clicks, unsubscribes, and conversions. Analyze all of them together and tell me what's working and what's not.
```

### 2. The agent processes and normalizes the data

The agent reads all CSV files, merges them, and cleans up inconsistencies:

```
Processed 142 campaigns from 6 CSV files (Jan-Jun 2026):
- Total sends: 847,000
- Average open rate: 24.3%
- Average click rate: 3.1%
- Average conversion rate: 0.8%
- 12 campaigns had missing conversion data (excluded from conversion analysis)
```

### 3. Get subject line analysis

The agent identifies patterns in your best and worst performing subject lines:

```
Subject Line Analysis:

Top patterns by open rate:
- Questions in subject line: 31.2% avg open rate (vs 24.3% baseline)
- Personalized with first name: 28.7% avg open rate
- Numbers/lists ("5 ways to..."): 27.9% avg open rate

Worst patterns:
- ALL CAPS words: 18.4% avg open rate
- "Newsletter" in subject: 19.1% avg open rate
- Over 60 characters: 20.2% avg open rate

Best performing subject line: "Did you see this, {first_name}?" — 38.4% open rate
```

### 4. Analyze send time and day performance

```
Break down performance by day of week and time of day. When should I be sending emails?
```

```
Send Time Analysis:

Best days by click rate:
1. Tuesday: 4.1% click rate
2. Thursday: 3.8% click rate
3. Wednesday: 3.2% click rate

Best send times by open rate:
1. 9:00-10:00 AM: 28.7% open rate
2. 1:00-2:00 PM: 26.1% open rate
3. 7:00-8:00 AM: 25.4% open rate

Avoid: Friday after 3 PM (17.2% open rate), weekends (15.8% open rate)
```

### 5. Get the full performance report

The agent produces a comprehensive report with recommendations:

```
Report generated: email-campaign-analysis-h1-2026.md

Key Recommendations:
1. Shift send schedule to Tuesday/Thursday at 9 AM (projected +26% opens)
2. Use question-based subject lines more frequently
3. Fix onboarding email #4 — 62% drop-off between email 3 and 4
4. Sunset the monthly newsletter format (lowest engagement across all campaigns)
5. A/B test personalized vs. non-personalized subject lines systematically
```

## Real-World Example

Marco is the growth marketer at a 20-person project management SaaS. He sends campaigns weekly but only glances at open rates in the email dashboard.

1. He exports 6 months of campaign CSVs and asks the agent to analyze everything
2. The agent reveals that question-based subject lines outperform all others by 28% — Marco had no idea
3. Send time analysis shows Tuesday at 9 AM dramatically outperforms his usual Friday sends
4. The onboarding sequence analysis uncovers a massive drop-off at email 4, which links to a confusing setup page
5. Marco restructures his send schedule and subject line approach. Over the next month, open rates increase from 24% to 31% and click-through rates nearly double

### Tips for Better Results

- Export at least 3 months of data to identify meaningful patterns, not noise
- Segment analysis by campaign type — onboarding sequences behave differently than promotional blasts
- Look at unsubscribe rates alongside open rates — high opens with high unsubs means clickbait subject lines
- Track conversions end-to-end, not just clicks — an email that gets clicks but no signups isn't working
- Test one variable at a time when acting on insights — changing send time and subject line simultaneously muddies the data
- Re-run the analysis monthly to track whether your changes are actually improving results
