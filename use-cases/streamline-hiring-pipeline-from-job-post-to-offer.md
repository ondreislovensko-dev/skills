# Streamline the Hiring Pipeline from Job Post to Offer Letter

## The Problem

A growing startup needs to fill 6 engineering positions in 8 weeks. The HR manager writes each job description from scratch, manually reviews 200+ resumes per role, and drafts individual offer letters with legal review for each hire. The process takes 12-15 hours per role just in administrative work. Inconsistent job descriptions attract the wrong candidates, resume screening is subjective depending on who reviews them, and offer letters take 3 days to produce because they shuttle between HR, legal, and the hiring manager for approval.

## The Solution

Using **job-description** to generate consistent, compelling postings, **applicant-screening** to score and rank candidates against role requirements, **resume-tailor** to analyze how well each resume maps to the role, and **offer-letter** to produce standardized offers with the correct compensation and legal terms, the startup compresses weeks of admin work into hours.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Generate standardized job descriptions

Create job postings that accurately describe each role's requirements, responsibilities, and compensation range.

> Use job-description to create a posting for Senior Backend Engineer. Requirements: 5+ years Python experience, PostgreSQL, distributed systems, AWS. The role reports to the VP of Engineering. Compensation: $165,000-$195,000 base plus 0.1-0.15% equity. Include our engineering culture values: code review rigor, on-call rotation, and 20% time for technical exploration. Output both a full JD for our careers page and a shortened version for LinkedIn.

### 2. Screen and rank incoming applications

Process the applicant pool against weighted criteria to surface the strongest candidates.

> Use applicant-screening to evaluate 214 applications for the Senior Backend Engineer role. Score each resume against these weighted criteria: Python experience (25%), distributed systems (20%), relevant industry experience (15%), education (10%), open source contributions (10%), communication signals from cover letter (10%), and culture fit indicators (10%). Flag candidates who meet all hard requirements and rank them by overall score. Output the top 30 candidates to /hiring/backend-senior/shortlist.csv.

The screening tool produces a ranked summary with scores broken down by criterion:

```text
Applicant Screening — Senior Backend Engineer
==============================================
Applications received: 214
Hard requirements met:  68 (31.8%)
Shortlisted (top 30):  30

Rank  Name              Score  Python  DistSys  Industry  Edu  OSS  Comms  Culture
  1   Sarah Chen        94.2   25/25   20/20    13/15     8/10 10/10  9/10   9.2/10
  2   Marcus Rivera     91.8   25/25   18/20    14/15     9/10  8/10  9/10   8.8/10
  3   Aisha Patel       89.5   23/25   19/20    12/15    10/10  9/10  8/10   8.5/10
  4   David Kim         87.3   24/25   17/20    13/15     7/10 10/10  8/10   8.3/10
  5   Elena Volkov      85.9   22/25   20/20    11/15     8/10  7/10  9/10   8.9/10
 ...
 30   James Okonkwo     72.1   20/25   14/20    10/15     8/10  6/10  7/10   7.1/10

Rejected (hard requirements not met): 146
  - Insufficient Python experience (<3 years): 89
  - No distributed systems background:        41
  - Missing cover letter:                      16

Output: /hiring/backend-senior/shortlist.csv
```

The rejection breakdown helps the recruiter understand whether the job posting is attracting the right applicant pool or needs adjustments to its requirements or distribution channels.

### 3. Analyze resume-to-role fit for shortlisted candidates

Deeply compare each shortlisted candidate's experience against the specific role requirements.

> Use resume-tailor to analyze the top 30 shortlisted resumes against the Senior Backend Engineer JD. For each candidate, produce a fit report: skills matched, skills missing, years of relevant experience, notable achievements, and a recommended interview focus area (the skill gap that the interview should validate). Flag any candidates whose resumes suggest they are overqualified or underqualified by more than 2 years of experience.

### 4. Generate offer letters for selected candidates

Produce legally compliant offer letters with correct compensation, equity terms, and start dates.

> Use offer-letter to generate an offer for candidate Sarah Chen. Base salary: $185,000. Equity: 0.12% over 4-year vest with 1-year cliff. Signing bonus: $15,000. Start date: March 17, 2026. Include standard clauses: at-will employment, confidentiality agreement, IP assignment, 90-day probation period, and benefits enrollment eligibility. Generate both PDF and DocuSign-ready formats. CC the VP of Engineering and legal counsel.

## Real-World Example

The startup ran this pipeline for all 6 engineering roles. Job descriptions were generated in 30 minutes total instead of 3 days. The screening tool processed 1,180 total applications across all roles and shortlisted 142 candidates in under 2 hours, compared to the 80+ hours it would have taken to review manually. The HR manager reported that interview-to-offer conversion improved from 1-in-5 to 1-in-3 because better screening meant interviewers spent time with genuinely qualified candidates. All 6 positions were filled in 6 weeks instead of the expected 8, and offer letters were delivered same-day instead of the previous 3-day turnaround.

## Tips

- Calibrate screening weights by having the hiring manager manually score 10 resumes first, then adjust the automated weights until the tool's ranking matches the manager's intuition.
- Keep the hard requirement threshold strict but the scoring flexible. A candidate with 4 years of Python but exceptional distributed systems experience should still surface above someone with exactly 5 years of Python and nothing else.
- Generate both a full-length job description for the careers page and a condensed version for job boards. LinkedIn posts with descriptions under 300 words receive significantly more applications than longer ones.
