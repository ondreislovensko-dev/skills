# Convert Figma Designs to Production Code with AI

## The Problem

The handoff from design to code is where velocity dies. A designer delivers pixel-perfect Figma mockups, then a frontend developer spends days manually translating them — eyeballing spacing, guessing responsive behavior, and copy-pasting hex colors. The result is inconsistent implementations, endless "can you move this 2px left" feedback rounds, and designers who lose trust in the engineering team's ability to match their vision. A single page with 5-6 components easily takes 2-3 days of frontend work.

## The Solution

An AI agent uses the `figma-to-code` skill to extract layout structure, design tokens, and component hierarchy from Figma designs, then generates responsive, accessible React components that match the design. Combined with `frontend-design` for polishing and responsive refinement, the full page goes from Figma to working code in under an hour.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install figma-to-code frontend-design
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Share the design

Give the agent your Figma file and specify your stack:

> Here's our new pricing page design: https://figma.com/file/abc123/Pricing-Page
> We use React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Generate production-ready components.

### 2. The agent extracts design structure

```text
Analyzed Figma file "Pricing Page" — 3 frames detected:

Frame 1: Hero Section (1440×480)
  - Headline: Inter 48px/56px semibold, #0F172A
  - Subtext: Inter 18px/28px regular, #64748B
  - Background: linear-gradient(135deg, #EFF6FF, #F8FAFC)

Frame 2: Pricing Cards (1440×520)
  - 3-column grid, 24px gap
  - Card: 384px wide, 16px padding, rounded-xl, shadow-md
  - Highlighted card: ring-2 ring-blue-500, scale-105
  - CTA button: blue-600, rounded-lg, full-width

Frame 3: FAQ Accordion (1440×400)
  - Max-width 768px, centered
  - 8 items, border-b separator

```

### 3. Receive production-ready components

```text
Generated 5 files:

components/PricingHero.tsx (32 lines)
  - Responsive headline: text-3xl md:text-5xl
  - Gradient background with Tailwind arbitrary values

components/PricingCard.tsx (58 lines)
  - Props: { name, price, period, features, highlighted, onSelect }
  - Toggle between monthly/yearly with animated price transition
  - Highlighted variant with ring and scale transform
  - Full keyboard accessibility on CTA button

components/PricingGrid.tsx (24 lines)
  - 3-column on desktop, single column on mobile
  - Highlighted card renders in center position

components/FaqAccordion.tsx (41 lines)
  - Uses shadcn/ui Accordion primitive
  - Props: { items: { question, answer }[] }

lib/pricing-tokens.ts (15 lines)
  - Exported design tokens: colors, spacing, typography matching Figma

All components use your Tailwind config. No hardcoded colors or magic numbers.
```

### 4. Refine responsive behavior

> The cards should stack on mobile but I want a horizontal scroll on tablet instead of stacking. Can you adjust?

```text
Updated PricingGrid.tsx:

- Mobile (< 640px): Single column stack
- Tablet (640-1024px): Horizontal scroll with snap points
  Added: overflow-x-auto snap-x snap-mandatory scroll-pl-6
  Each card: snap-center min-w-[320px]
- Desktop (> 1024px): 3-column grid (unchanged)

Added touch-friendly scroll indicators for tablet view.

## Real-World Example

Sana is a frontend developer at a 20-person SaaS startup. The design team just finished a redesign of the dashboard — 8 new screens, 23 unique components. The PM wants it shipped in two weeks. Normally this would take a month.

1. Sana shares the Figma file with the AI agent and specifies the tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and their custom component library built on Radix primitives
2. The agent processes all 8 screens, identifies 14 truly unique components (the other 9 are variants), and extracts a consistent token set that maps to the existing Tailwind config
3. Over two days, Sana reviews and integrates the generated components — tweaking responsive breakpoints and wiring up data fetching. The agent generated 85% of the CSS and JSX correctly on the first pass
4. For the remaining 15%, Sana screenshots the discrepancy ("the card shadow is too heavy on this component") and the agent adjusts the specific values
5. The dashboard redesign ships in 9 days. The design team reviews and finds only 3 minor spacing adjustments needed — down from the usual 20+ rounds of feedback
