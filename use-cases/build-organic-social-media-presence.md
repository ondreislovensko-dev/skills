# Build an Organic Social Media Presence

## The Problem

Your startup has 340 Instagram followers (mostly friends and family) and a TikTok account with two videos from six months ago. You know short-form video is the most effective organic channel in 2026, but creating content consistently across platforms feels overwhelming. Each platform has different formats, different algorithms, and different audience expectations. Posting the same content everywhere gets punished by algorithms that reward native content.

Hiring a social media manager costs $4,000-6,000/month. Agencies charge $3,000-8,000. For a bootstrapped company, that budget does not exist. But doing nothing means competitors with active social presences capture the audience you need.

## The Solution

Use **instagram-marketing** to build a Reels-first content strategy optimized for the Instagram algorithm, **tiktok-marketing** to adapt content for TikTok's discovery-driven feed, and **social-content** to generate platform-native post copy, hooks, and hashtag strategies for both platforms simultaneously.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit your niche and find content gaps

Before creating anything, understand what already works in your space and where the opportunities are.

> Analyze the top 10 accounts in the project management SaaS niche on Instagram and TikTok. What content formats get the most engagement? Where are the gaps?

The agent identifies dominant formats (tutorial Reels, "day in the life" TikToks, before/after workflows) and underserved angles (no one is making content about remote team coordination pain points or async meeting alternatives).

### 2. Build a 30-day content calendar

Consistency matters more than perfection. A calendar removes the daily decision of what to post.

> Create a 30-day content calendar for Instagram (4 Reels, 3 carousels, 2 Stories per week) and TikTok (5 videos per week). Theme: productivity tips for remote teams. Include hooks for each post.

The agent produces a day-by-day calendar with specific hooks and formats for each platform:

```text
WEEK 1 — Content Calendar
===========================

Mon  Instagram Reel     "Stop doing standups wrong"           CTA: Save this
     TikTok Video       "Your standup is wasting 5hrs/week"   CTA: Follow for pt 2

Tue  Instagram Carousel "5 async tools that replaced meetings" CTA: Share with team
     TikTok Video       "This one Slack setting changed everything" CTA: Try it now

Wed  Instagram Story    Poll: "How many meetings today? 0-2 / 3-5 / 6+"
     TikTok Video       "POV: you just cancelled all recurring meetings" CTA: Stitch this

Thu  Instagram Reel     "The 2-minute rule for remote teams"  CTA: Link in bio
     TikTok Video       "Reply to @user: how we do standups async" CTA: Comment yours

Fri  Instagram Carousel "Monday.com vs Notion for remote teams" CTA: Save for later
     TikTok Video       "Remote team fails compilation"        CTA: Duet with yours
     Instagram Story    Q&A: "Ask me about remote workflows"
```

Each post has a format, hook, key talking points, and a CTA tailored to the platform. The calendar alternates between educational content (tutorials, tool comparisons) and relatable content (fails, POV sketches) to maintain engagement variety.

### 3. Generate post copy and hashtag sets

Writing captions and researching hashtags for 40+ posts per month is tedious. Batch-generate everything at once.

> Write Instagram captions and TikTok descriptions for the first two weeks of the calendar. Include 20-25 hashtags for Instagram and 4-5 for TikTok per post. Add a CTA to each.

The agent produces platform-specific copy: longer story-driven captions for Instagram with strategic hashtag clusters, shorter punchy descriptions for TikTok with trending audio suggestions. CTAs alternate between "save this post," "follow for more," and "link in bio."

### 4. Optimize posting schedule and track what works

Posting at random times wastes good content. Use platform data to find optimal windows.

> Based on our niche (B2B productivity, US audience), recommend posting times for Instagram and TikTok. Create a tracking spreadsheet to measure what content types perform best.

The agent recommends specific time slots (Instagram: Tuesday/Thursday 7-8 AM and 12-1 PM EST; TikTok: Monday-Friday 10 AM and 7 PM EST) and builds a tracking template with columns for format, hook type, views, engagement rate, saves, and shares.

## Real-World Example

Dev, the founder of an async standup tool, had 280 Instagram followers after a year. He ran the three-skill workflow and discovered that no competitor was making content about the specific pain of timezone-scattered teams. He built a 30-day calendar focused entirely on "remote team fails" -- relatable content about miscommunication, meeting overload, and lost context.

The batch-generated copy saved him 6 hours per week of caption writing. He repurposed each Instagram Reel into a TikTok with adjusted hooks and descriptions. By week three, a TikTok about "when your standup takes longer than the actual work" hit 184,000 views. Instagram Reels averaged 2,400 views versus his previous 90. After 60 days of consistent posting, he had 4,200 Instagram followers and 8,700 TikTok followers. More importantly, 340 people clicked through to his landing page from social bios, and 28 started free trials -- all without spending a dollar on ads.
