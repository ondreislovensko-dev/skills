# Fix API Documentation Drift with AI

## The Problem

API documentation goes stale the moment a developer merges a route change without updating the spec. A backend engineer adds a required field to an endpoint, another renames a query parameter, and within weeks the OpenAPI spec is a liability rather than a contract. Client teams build against wrong schemas, mobile releases ship with broken API calls, and the on-call engineer spends Friday night debugging a 422 error caused by an undocumented field rename three sprints ago. Studies consistently show that documentation drift is the number-one complaint in developer experience surveys — and manually diffing route files against YAML specs is nobody's idea of productive work.

## The Solution

Point your AI agent at the codebase and existing OpenAPI spec. It scans route definitions, extracts current schemas from type annotations, diffs them against the published spec, and produces an updated OpenAPI document plus a human-readable changelog. Then it validates every updated endpoint actually works by hitting it with test requests.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install api-doc-generator api-tester code-reviewer
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Scan the codebase for documentation drift

```
Compare our OpenAPI spec at docs/openapi.yaml against the actual route handlers in src/routes/ and src/controllers/. List every discrepancy — missing endpoints, removed endpoints, and schema changes.
```

The agent parses the existing OpenAPI file, walks through every route handler, and produces a drift report:

```
Documentation Drift Report
===========================
5 discrepancies found across 34 endpoints.

Added in code (missing from docs):
  POST /api/v2/teams/:teamId/invites       — src/controllers/teams.ts:87
  GET  /api/v2/billing/usage-summary        — src/controllers/billing.ts:203

Removed from code (stale in docs):
  DELETE /api/v2/users/:id/sessions         — removed in commit e4a12bf (Jan 14)

Schema changes:
  POST /api/v2/users — new required field "workspaceId" (string, added Feb 3)
  GET  /api/v2/projects/:id — response field "owner" changed from string to object {id, name, email}
```

### 2. Generate the updated OpenAPI spec

```
Generate an updated openapi.yaml that fixes all 5 discrepancies. Keep the existing descriptions and examples where they're still accurate. Add realistic examples for new fields.
```

The agent produces a clean OpenAPI 3.0.3 document with properly referenced schemas, updated paths, and example values derived from type definitions in the codebase.

### 3. Validate endpoints against the new spec

```
Hit each of the 5 changed endpoints on our staging server at https://staging-api.internal:3000 and verify the responses match the updated spec. Use the test auth token from .env.staging.
```

The agent runs targeted requests and reports:

```
Endpoint Validation Results
============================
✓ POST /api/v2/teams/:teamId/invites — 201, schema matches
✓ GET  /api/v2/billing/usage-summary — 200, schema matches
✓ POST /api/v2/users — 200, "workspaceId" required field confirmed
✗ GET  /api/v2/projects/:id — 200, but "owner.email" is null when docs say required
  → Recommendation: mark owner.email as nullable in the spec

4/5 passed. 1 spec adjustment recommended.
```

### 4. Review the diff for quality

```
Review the diff between the old and new openapi.yaml. Flag any breaking changes that need a version bump or client notification.
```

The agent identifies:

```
Breaking Change Analysis
=========================
1 BREAKING: POST /api/v2/users now requires "workspaceId"
  → Clients sending requests without this field will get 422
  → Recommend: bump to v3, add migration guide, or make field optional with default

1 NON-BREAKING: GET /api/v2/projects/:id "owner" expanded from string to object
  → Additive change, but clients parsing owner as string will break
  → Recommend: document in changelog, notify frontend team

0 SAFE: New endpoints (POST invites, GET usage-summary) — additive only
```

## Real-World Example

A backend engineer at a 40-person B2B SaaS company inherits an API serving 12 client integrations. The OpenAPI spec hasn't been updated in 3 months despite 47 commits touching route files. Two enterprise clients have filed support tickets about undocumented field changes breaking their integrations.

1. The engineer asks the agent to scan 86 endpoints across 14 controller files against the existing spec
2. The agent finds 11 discrepancies: 3 new endpoints, 1 removed endpoint, and 7 schema changes
3. It generates an updated spec in 30 seconds — work that would take a developer 4-6 hours manually
4. Endpoint validation catches 2 cases where the code behavior doesn't match even the new spec, revealing bugs
5. The breaking change review identifies 2 changes requiring client notification, which the engineer sends before the next release

The result: an accurate spec, two bugs caught, and client trust restored — in under 20 minutes instead of a full day.
