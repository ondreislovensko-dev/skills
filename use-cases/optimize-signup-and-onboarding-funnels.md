# Optimize Signup and Onboarding Funnels

## The Problem

Your SaaS landing page gets 3,000 visitors per month, but only 90 start the signup flow, and only 54 complete it. Of those 54, only 19 finish onboarding and reach the "aha moment." That is a 0.6% visitor-to-activated-user rate. You are losing people at every step: the signup form asks for too much information, the onboarding wizard has seven screens before users see any value, and the email verification step adds friction that causes 34% of signups to never return.

Each drop-off point compounds. A 10% improvement at signup, a 15% improvement at onboarding, and a 10% improvement at activation multiply into a 40% increase in activated users -- without spending a dollar more on acquisition.

## The Solution

Use **signup-flow-cro** to audit and streamline the registration process, **form-cro** to optimize every form field for completion rate, and **onboarding-cro** to redesign the first-run experience so users reach value faster.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit the current signup funnel

Identify exactly where and why people drop off between landing page and account creation.

> Audit our signup flow at app.taskflow.io/signup. We have a 3-step form: email/password, company info, team size. Completion rate is 60%. Find the friction points.

The agent analyzes the flow and identifies specific issues: the company name field is required but unnecessary for initial signup, the password requirements are displayed only after submission (causing error frustration), and the team size step feels like a sales qualification question that makes users distrust the process.

### 2. Optimize form fields for completion

Every unnecessary field costs conversions. Reduce the form to the minimum viable information needed to create an account.

> Redesign our signup form to maximize completion rate. Currently: email, password, full name, company name, company size, role. What should we keep, cut, or defer?

The agent recommends a single-step form with email and password only -- name, company, and role move to a progressive profiling step after the user has experienced value. This pattern consistently lifts form completion rates by 25-40% across B2B SaaS. The agent also recommends adding Google SSO as the primary signup method, since SSO typically converts 2-3x higher than email/password forms.

### 3. Redesign onboarding for time-to-value

The onboarding flow should get users to their first meaningful outcome in under three minutes.

> Our onboarding has 7 steps before users can create their first project. Redesign it so users see value in under 2 minutes. Our aha moment is "creating a task and seeing it on a board."

The agent restructures onboarding from a linear wizard into a "do one thing" flow: skip the tutorial screens, drop the user directly into a pre-populated sample project, and prompt them to create their first task immediately. Profile completion, integrations, and team invites become contextual prompts that appear after the user has experienced core value.

### 4. Implement and measure improvements

Roll out changes with proper measurement to quantify the impact at each funnel stage.

> Set up funnel tracking for our new signup and onboarding flow. I need to see drop-off rates at each step and compare against our baseline.

The agent defines a funnel with events at each step (page_view, form_start, form_submit, email_verified, onboarding_started, first_task_created, onboarding_completed) and builds a comparison dashboard that shows the old and new flows side by side with conversion rates at each stage.

## Real-World Example

Marcus ran product at a 30-person project management SaaS with a persistent activation problem. Of 3,200 monthly signups, only 640 completed onboarding -- an 80% drop-off between account creation and first meaningful use. The seven-step onboarding wizard (choose template, invite team, connect integrations, watch tutorial video, set preferences, create workspace, create first project) took an average of 11 minutes to complete.

He ran the three-skill workflow on a Thursday. The signup form audit revealed the company size dropdown was causing 18% of form abandoners to leave -- people did not want to disclose that information before seeing the product. Removing it and two other deferrable fields lifted form completion from 60% to 79%. The onboarding redesign eliminated five of seven steps and dropped users directly into a sample workspace with a single prompt: "Create your first task." Average time-to-first-task dropped from 11 minutes to 94 seconds.

After 30 days, the activated user count went from 640 to 1,380 per month on the same traffic. Signup completion rose from 60% to 82%, and onboarding completion jumped from 20% to 53%. The compound effect of fixing three funnel stages more than doubled the number of users who actually experienced the product -- without changing the product itself or increasing ad spend by a cent.
